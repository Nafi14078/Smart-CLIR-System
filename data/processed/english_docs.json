    "body": "With streets across the country increasingly dominated by battery-powered rickshaws and e-bikes, the question must be asked: Has this transport revolution, which has unquestionably reduced physical labour for hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis no longer needing to haul vehicles, outpaced the state’s ability to govern? Battery-powered rickshaws have been deemed unsafe from the moment they were on the streets. With drivers regularly flouting traffic rules at alarming speeds, it has become more urgent than ever to have some sort of regulation around them. As things currently stand, with millions of battery-powered vehicles operating nationwide, what began as an affordable mobility option has unfortunately metastasized into a crisis of lawlessness and power theft. It is the illegal charging points siphoning electricity, unregistered factories producing rickshaws, and informal garages dismantling expired lead-acid batteries that are some of the glaring issues that must be addressed. We understand that banning these vehicles outright was never the solution, and attempts to do so in the past have predictably failed. However, while there are countless individuals who rely on them for livelihoods and affordable transport, the solution has to be regulation. Here again, it is the job of the law enforcement agencies to do better, and not only ensure regulations but crack down on the garages and illegal charging points and factories that make these vehicles a liability rather than an asset for the nation. For too long have we let battery-powered vehicles operate unchecked - yet again we are trading short-term convenience for long-term catastrophe. We need them registered and regulated, for the betterment of the entire country.",

    "body": "With Bangladesh looking ahead eagerly towards a new political chapter, and with numerous parties and leaders expressing their views on the best course of action for the nation, there are several issues that must stand above partisan divides.Of those, ensuring better healthcare for the people of this country must be placed at the centre of the next government’s agenda. It is truly shocking that quality, affordable care has become a distant dream for most people. While we cannot expect our healthcare system to transform overnight, what we do need is acceptance that we are lagging behind, and then for the government to begin addressing the issues that plague it immediately.As things stand, Bangladesh’s health system remains underfunded and overstretched, with the sector spending below 3% of GDP - far short of benchmarks. Such chronic underinvestment is the reason why citizens continue to shoulder soaring medical costs out of pocket, pushing countless families into poverty. In particular, healthcare is where the inequities within the country are particularly stark, with urban centres enjoying better-equipped hospitals while rural clinics routinely struggle with shortages of doctors, medicines, and diagnostic tools. However, with a country’s doctor-to-patient ratio that remains among the lowest in South Asia, it is the entire system that has all but failed the people, resulting in a population perpetually weakened.From raising health expenditure to expanding primary care facilities in rural areas, from ensuring medicines and diagnostics are available to starting to introduce health insurance schemes to reduce household burdens - these are all steps that can be taken moving forward. Equally vital is investment in medical education alongside more robust preventive campaigns so that we are not always playing catch-up when healthcare crises are upon us.Healthcare should never be a privilege, and the next government must recognize that investing in health is investing in our future.",

    "title": "Between hysteria and denial: Rethinking national security in Bangladesh",
    "body": "When people think about Bangladesh’s national security, they often picture the loud stuff: Checkpoints, raids, and the kind of breaking news that arrives after something has already gone wrong. But there’s another side that stays mostly invisible until it suddenly isn’t: A Facebook page quietly normalizing a militant worldview, a “training” video passed around in private groups, a small self-defense circle meeting somewhere in a neighbourhood or a distant village. Each piece, on its own, looks easy to ignore. Together, they form a pattern. Look at how quickly the quiet becomes concrete. A blast in Shariatpur killed a 20-year-old on January 8, 2026. It had left two others critically injured. On December 28, 2025, we saw another explosion at a madrasa in South Keraniganj. Police recovered bomb-like objects and a large volume of chemicals. In both cases, law enforcement agencies suspect that these people were trying to make bombs. In one case, a suspect had prior extremist links. Lately, if you scroll through reels or short videos, you may have noticed a pattern. Clips of so-called “Islamic State training,” Al-Qaeda style footage, or battlefield montages appear in your feed, often with Bangla subtitles and dramatic background music. Many of the accounts that post them are new, opened in the last year or so, and they follow each other closely, forming a small ecosystem. Alongside this, there are pages advertising martial arts or “fitness training for young Muslims,” where the language in the caption or the comments moves beyond health and discipline and starts hinting at a more ideological goal: Prepare yourself for a different kind of struggle. If you look at any one of these in isolation, you can easily shrug. Someone is farming clicks. Someone else is trying to monetize religious sentiment. Some young men want to learn karate. Fair enough. But once you start connecting the dots, a different picture appears. You can see a cluster of accounts feeding off the same imagery, recycling the same slogans, and slowly normalizing the idea that physical training plus a certain kind of religious rhetoric equals a higher, almost militant, purpose. That is the point where the question of national security enters. Bangladesh has already paid a heavy price for underestimating these patterns. We do not need to guess what can happen when fringe ideas are left to grow without monitoring. In August 2005, Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) carried out near-simultaneous bomb blasts in 63 districts in a single day. It was a coordinated message: “We are everywhere.” For years before that, there had been smaller incidents, pamphlets, and whispers about rising militancy. Many dismissed them as isolated or exaggerated. The bombs proved otherwise. A decade later, in July 2016, the Holey Artisan attack in Dhaka’s diplomatic zone shocked the country again. Whatever people think about how the incident was later used politically by the then government, the core fact cannot be wished away: Armed young men stormed a café, killed Bangladeshi and foreign citizens, and pledged loyalty to a transnational jihadist project. Families lost their children. A sense of safety in the capital was badly shaken. Pretending this was just “theatre” or “drama” is not only disrespectful to victims, it also weakens our ability to see similar risks when they reappear in new forms. Since then, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have kept many militant outfits under pressure. There is no question that some plots have been disrupted and some networks dismantled. At the same time, there is also a widely shared perception that counter-terror laws and special units were sometimes turned inward with political motives. Sometimes they have been used against political opponents rather than genuine extremist threats. Reports by local and international bodies have documented how tools built to fight terrorism were used to manage elections, protests, or party rivalries. So we ended up in a strange situation: Some citizens began to believe that “terrorism” itself is a political fiction, a tool to attack opposition, rather than a real danger. This belief is risky in its own way. When people start to think that every mention of extremism is just a trick, they ignore real warning signs. So, if you bring up concerns about Islamic State videos in Bangla, unexplained explosions in religious places, or secret training camps disguised as gyms, people may dismiss you as repeating an old story. They say: “We have heard this before. It’s just another excuse to control us.” This is where we need a more balanced and honest conversation. On one side, there are mainstream political parties like Awami League, BNP, Jamaat, NCP, and other leftist and centrist groups. Even though they often criticize each other, they mostly work within the rules of elections and the constitution. They compete for power through alliances, campaigns, and sometimes strikes or blockades, and occasionally through confrontation. But at their core, they agree that government should be decided through politics. On the other side, there are smaller networks that do not fully accept the framework of the Bangladesh Republic. For them, the dream is not a more democratic or more accountable Bangladesh, but a fundamentally different kind of state based on a particular interpretation of Islam. Their language rejects compromise and coexistence, the core idea of their religion. Their heroes are not parliamentarians or community organizers, but fighters in distant wars on the Afghan-Pakistan border. They are patient, they invest in teaching, preaching, training, and slow recruitment, and they have learned to use online platforms very well. These actors do not need a large visible presence to create damage; even a handful of committed individuals can change the security calculus. The challenge for the state is to respond without repeating past mistakes. If the state apparatus considers every critical voice, every religious activist, every student group as a potential terrorist and a threat to national security, we will end up exactly where we were before. It will lead to the abuse of laws and damage trust in institutions. The public will refuse to believe any warning, even when it is genuine. On the other hand, if the state swings to the opposite extreme and assumes that all talk of extremism is just “fear-mongering by the old regime,” we will keep walking with our eyes closed while new networks quietly organize. A more constructive approach First, it means taking online ecosystems seriously without panicking about every post. The government has the capacity to map clusters of pages and accounts that systematically push violent jihadist content in Bangla for a wider audience. Most of these pages are new, anonymous, and mutually linked. That kind of analysis is different from blanket surveillance of everyone. It is closer to good policing: Identify patterns, look at behaviour over time, and focus only on those who are clearly endorsing or glorifying organized violence. Second, it means treating educational and religious institutions as partners, not suspects. When an explosion happens in a madrasa compound, the question should not end with a short news item. Citizens deserve clear answers regarding such events: Who brought explosives there, why they were stored, and which networks were involved. Transparency is a must in such cases. At the same time, most madrasas and mosques are not part of any violent plot. They are often the victims of fringe groups who use these platforms as their hiding place. Madrasas and universities are spaces where millions of families send their children in good faith. Bringing their teachers and administrators into a transparent conversation about safety is far more effective than demonizing them from a distance. Third, it requires a clean separation between counter-terror work and partisan politics. If the same unit that investigates bomb-making also raids opposition offices on election eve, citizens' confidence will never recover. They will not trust these specialized groups that are created to fight terrorism. A democratic state has every right to defend itself against groups that reject peaceful politics, but it has to do so under clear legal rules, judicial oversight, and with space for media and civil society to ask questions. National security cannot become a magic word that ends all debate. Finally, there is a social side to this issue. Young people who get involved with extremist pages or training groups are often not villains. Many are looking for meaning, respect, and a sense of strength in a society and political system that can be disappointing. If mainstream institutions cannot give them a real sense of purpose, others will step in. Solving this is not about propaganda; it is about creating real ways for people to take part, fair policing, and making sure everyone feels the system, though imperfect, still belongs to them. In the end, the idea is simple. Bangladesh will be safest when all major political groups, from the secular left to the religious right, compete openly under democratic rules. The small minority that rejects these rules should be watched closely, dealt with by law, and given chances to change when possible. This is not weakness; it is strategic patience. So when you see another “training” reel with familiar black flags and Bangla subtitles while scrolling your social media, it is worth pausing for a second. Maybe it is just clickbait. A responsible state and government does not jump to conclusions, but neither does it ignore the recurring pattern. Between hysteria and denial, the Bangladesh government needs to find a middle path. National security thinking should be prioritized. Asif Bin Ali is an Atlanta based geopolitical analyst and currently working with Georgia State University, USA. Email: [email protected].",

    "title": "When Tehran burns, the world feels the heat",
    "body": "The Iranian streets are in uproar. What started as demonstrations due to economic difficulties and the political frustrations turned into one of the gravest domestic issues faced by the Iranian state in years. The violent crackdown on protesters, the news of thousands of demonstrators murdered, has not only rattled the Iranian society but also plunged it into a renewed risky confrontation with the United States. Donald Trump renewed threats against Tehran, warning of consequences over the killing of protesters. Tehran also warned Washington it would attack US bases all over the Middle East. If war breaks out between the US and Iran, it will have repercussions all over the world. The ripple effect of internal repression and external pressure, particularly by Washington, affects global markets, and eventually countries like Bangladesh suffer from higher prices and low growth. Iran is at the centre of the world energy map. Not only is it a force that produces oil, but it is also adjacent to the Strait of Hormuz where much of the oil and gas that is shipped in the world passes daily. The threat of regional escalation is always high whenever Iran feels surrounded in some way by sanctions, protests, or foreign threats. This is instinctively comprehended by markets. The oil prices are built upon fear because oil prices do not wait till the bombs fall. The recent protests and Trump’s threats have already rekindled those fears. Investors understand it is a regime under internal pressure which is more unpredictable. To the world economy, the consequences are not new yet they are also not any less grave. An increase in oil prices introduces inflation, slows down growth, and makes monetary policy more difficult across the globe. In the case of developing countries, the damage is more acute. They bring in inflation without bringing influence. Bangladesh is one of them as it imports most of its fuel. Any increase in world oil prices has a direct impact of increasing the import bill, reducing foreign exchange reserves, and exerting pressure on the taka. Once oil is made costly, the price of transportation increases as does the cost of electricity production and eventually food prices. Ordinary citizens are left with the greatest burden. It is not some abstract issue. Bangladesh is already facing the pressure of inflation, weak currency, and limited liquidity of dollars. An energy shock emitted by the instability of the Middle East would be fuel to an already burning fire. They can discuss buffers and adjustments, but the fact is that imported inflation is difficult to neutralize in a consumer-based economy. Energy is not the only potential risk. Another weakness is the deep labour and remittance relationships that Bangladesh has with the Middle East. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi labourers make their living in Gulf nations, countries whose economies strongly depend on the stability of the region. Remittance flows thus may decrease in case instability in Iran leads to greater regional tension or if sanctions and counter-sanctions affect the economies in the Gulf. In the case of Bangladesh, it will translate into a strain both on household incomes and foreign exchange reserves. Exports are equally exposed. The garment industry in Bangladesh relies on consistent world demand and a reliable supply chain. The cost of fuel rising raises the costs of shipping and insurance. Lack of confidence in the world markets decreases consumer expenditure in the Western market. Combined, these forces put export competitiveness on a squeezer at both ends. Once imports are more expensive and exports are not doing well, the balance of payments becomes dangerously constrained. The Iranian unrest has a larger lesson to Bangladesh and other developing countries. They emphasize that economic hardship coupled with political inflexibility may result in instability of the global scale. The protesters in Iran are fueled by not only the political oppression but also the lack of jobs, high inflation rates, and scuttled opportunities. These pressures have been exacerbated by sanctions though the failure of governance has increased these strains. The reality is that Bangladesh cannot do much about what is happening. Bangladesh does not shape oil prices. The relationship between the US and Iran is not something Bangladesh can control. As such, the diversification of energy can no longer be a future goal. Being less reliant on imported fossil fuels, encouraging greater development of renewables, and energy efficiency are targets we must strive for. The diversification of exports must also be explored; our economy is vulnerable as it depends on one area during times of global uncertainties. Social resilience has a lesson associated with it, too as it is the poorest who are injured by external shocks. Bangladesh might appear to be miles away but time and again, history tells us that geopolitics knows no geographical borders. The fires of Iran and the language of Washington are yet to find their way down into Dhaka, but economically, their heat is already being experienced.

    "title": "Running on empty",
    "body": "Bangladesh’s gas crisis did not arrive as a sudden shock; it crept in quietly, disguised as policy pragmatism and short-term fixes, until it became a structural threat to the economy. What is unfolding now is not merely a seasonal shortage or a logistical hiccup, but the cumulative consequence of years of strategic neglect, compounded by global volatility and domestic inertia. The numbers alone tell a story of exhaustion. The country currently demands around 3.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day, while supply lingers at roughly 2.58 billion cubic feet, leaving a daily deficit of 1.22 billion cubic feet. Even compared to the same period last year, supply has fallen by 176 million cubic feet per day. For an economy whose industrial backbone, power generation, and fertilizer production depend overwhelmingly on gas, this gap is not technical; it is existential. The roots of this imbalance lie in a policy choice made years ago: To manage scarcity through imports rather than confront it through exploration. During the previous government’s tenure, liquefied natural gas was elevated from a stopgap solution to a structural pillar of energy policy. Instead of aggressively investing in onshore and offshore exploration, Bangladesh chose the predictability of foreign cargoes, even as global energy markets grew more volatile and geopolitics more intrusive. The financial cost of this choice is staggering. Since the 2018–19 fiscal year, the country has spent or committed to spend more than Tk 2.56 trillion on LNG imports. In the current fiscal year alone, plans are in place to import 115 cargoes at an estimated cost of Tk 51,540 crore, significantly higher than the previous year. These figures reflect not only rising volumes, but also the growing price of dependency. Meanwhile, domestic production has been quietly eroding. Four of the five companies extracting gas in Bangladesh have recorded declines over the past year. Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited saw production fall by more than 500 million cubic metres year-on-year. Bapex’s output dropped by around 14%. Even Chevron, which supplies nearly half of the country’s gas through its three onshore fields, experienced a decline of over one billion cubic metres in a single year. Only one operator showed a marginal increase, insufficient to offset the broader trend. This is not a coincidence; it is what depletion looks like when exploration stagnates and development lags behind demand growth. Adding to this fragility is inefficiency within the system itself. Around 150 million cubic feet of gas is reportedly lost from the grid every day due to leaks, technical losses, and mismanagement. In such a scenario, drilling new wells without fixing transmission and distribution inefficiencies is akin to pouring water into a cracked vessel. The result is predictable: New supply fails to translate into meaningful relief, while costs continue to rise. The interim government inherited this crisis with high public expectations. As a caretaker authority overseeing a critical political transition, it was seen as uniquely positioned to take difficult, long-term decisions insulated from electoral pressures. Energy, the lifeblood of the economy, was expected to be an early priority. Yet more than a year into its tenure, the crisis appears deeper, not eased. Import dependence remains entrenched, local production continues to decline, and infrastructure expansion has barely moved beyond announcements. Two floating LNG terminals currently supply the grid, together capable of handling about one billion cubic feet per day. This capacity is already insufficient, yet tangible progress on new terminals remains elusive. Building another floating terminal, even if approved today, would take at least three years to become operational. By then, the interim government will be long gone, and the political cost deferred to an elected successor. This pattern of postponement, where today’s inaction becomes tomorrow’s inherited problem, has become a recurring feature of Bangladesh’s energy governance. The risks of this approach extend beyond balance sheets. Global energy markets are increasingly shaped by sanctions, conflicts, and strategic rivalries. Recent disruptions in LPG supply, triggered by sanctions affecting shipping and trading routes, offer a glimpse of how external events can suddenly constrict access to fuel. For a country that imports a growing share of its primary energy, such shocks can quickly cascade through the economy, shutting down factories, reducing export capacity, and straining foreign exchange reserves. Bangladesh is discovering, belatedly, that energy security is inseparable from national security. The industrial impact is already visible. Many factories operate for months without adequate gas pressure; others have shut down entirely. Power plants built at great cost sit underutilized for lack of fuel. Export-oriented industries, particularly those competing on thin margins, face rising production costs and declining reliability. At a time when Bangladesh seeks to attract foreign investment and diversify its economy, persistent energy shortages send a deeply discouraging signal. Investors may tolerate policy uncertainty; they rarely tolerate unreliable energy. To be fair, plans do exist. An integrated energy roadmap stretching from 2026 to 2050 envisions phased reforms and investments worth an estimated $70-80 billion. There are promises of drilling 100 wells by 2028, purchasing new rigs, updating production-sharing contracts, and reducing reliance on spot LNG through short-term agreements. These are not trivial measures. Yet plans, in the absence of urgency and coordination, risk becoming another layer of deferred responsibility. Energy systems do not respond to intent; they respond to execution. What is most troubling is the continued absence of a clear exit strategy from LNG dependency. Importing LNG can stabilize supply in the short run, but it cannot anchor an economy indefinitely, especially one vulnerable to currency pressure and external shocks. Without a defined timeline to reduce imports and replace them with domestic production, LNG risks becoming a permanent crutch, draining public finances while crowding out investment in exploration. The opportunity cost is immense. Every taka spent on expensive spot cargoes is a taka not invested in seismic surveys, offshore drilling, or modern grid management. Bangladesh’s gas story is ultimately a lesson in policy time horizons. Exploration does not yield immediate political dividends; imports do. Infrastructure takes years; cargoes arrive in weeks. But nations that prioritize convenience over capacity eventually pay a higher price. The current crisis is not merely about gas shortages; it is about the erosion of strategic autonomy. An economy that cannot fuel its factories without navigating sanctions regimes and shipping constraints is an economy exposed to forces beyond its control. The interim government still has limited time to shape the contours of what comes next. Even if it cannot deliver immediate relief, it can establish credibility by locking in irreversible steps toward exploration, efficiency, and diversification. Failing that, the burden will fall on the next elected government, which will inherit not only depleted fields and expensive contracts, but also public frustration and industrial fatigue. Bangladesh once built its growth narrative on affordable energy. That advantage is slipping away. Reclaiming it will require more than cargoes and committees; it will require a decisive break from the politics of postponement. Without that, the country risks running its economy on empty, sustained by imports, vulnerable to shocks, and perpetually one crisis away from paralysis.

    "body": "The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has launched a system to automatically credit income tax paid at the import stage in the taxpayer's e-return. For this purpose, it was launched from Sunday after completing the effective connection process of NBR's e-return system with Asycuda World. As a result, the long-standing suffering of taxpayers in getting credit against advance income tax payment at the import stage has come to an end. At the same time, the e-return filing process has become easier and more transparent for importer traders. According to the NBR, while entering business income information in the e-return, the importer taxpayer will automatically see all the information on advance income tax paid against each bill of entry in the relevant income year. This income tax paid at the import stage will be automatically adjusted from the total income tax payable in the e-return system to calculate the final amount payable in the return. Meanwhile, since the launch of the online e-return filing program for the 2025-26 tax year on the website www.etaxnbr.gov.bd by Finance Adviser Dr. Salehuddin Ahmed on August 4, 2025, there has been a huge response. According to NBR data, so far more than 4.6 million taxpayers have registered in the e-return system and about 3.3 million taxpayers have already filed their returns online. It is noteworthy that those for whom e-return filing is not mandatory are also voluntarily filing their returns online. In addition, expatriate Bangladeshi taxpayers are also getting the opportunity to file their returns online by registering in the e-return system in the current tax year. So far, about 4,000 expatriate Bangladeshis have filed their income tax returns for the 2025-26 tax year online. The NBR also said that there is no need to upload any papers or documents for filing e-returns online. All activities of the NBR are continuing so that individual taxpayers can easily pay income tax and file returns from home. The National Board of Revenue has requested all individual taxpayers to file their income tax returns online using the e-return system by January 31, 2026.",

While this technology is relatively familiar in cars, it is still quite new in the motorcycle segment. With the combined initiative of Yamaha and ACI Motors, hybrid-technology motorcycles are entering the country’s market. In introducing new technologies to Bangladesh’s motorcycle industry, Yamaha and ACI Motors have consistently played a pioneering role. Continuing this legacy, on January 16 at Le Méridien Dhaka, ACI Motors, the sole distributor of Yamaha motorcycles in Bangladesh, officially announced the launch of Yamaha FZS Hybrid in the motorcycle market. For quite some time, there had been widespread speculation and excitement among motorcycle enthusiasts regarding the arrival of a high-technology bike. This model has already generated strong interest among bike lovers. Equipped with cutting-edge technology, the Yamaha FZS Hybrid features a hybrid engine that runs on a combination of fuel and battery power. Compared to conventional motorcycles, it delivers better mileage, quicker pickup, and reduced carbon emissions-making it more environment friendly. The Yamaha FZS Hybrid comes with a fully loaded 4.2-inch TFT digital display, gear indicator, turn-by-turn navigation, LED headlamp, tail lamp, LED indicators, and a Smart Start & Stop System, which minimizes the hassle of manually switching the engine off and on at traffic signals. In addition, it features Yamaha Y-Connect Bluetooth technology for enhanced connectivity.

    "body": "Novelist and essayist Md Ashanur Rahman has been awarded The International Creative Arts Award 2025 by the International Creative Arts, Language & Development Research Centre of the University of Dhaka for his outstanding contribution to literature and its role in “Enriching Minds and Inspiring Lives.” The award ceremony was held at the R C Mujumdar Hall of Dhaka University recently. The honor was conferred in recognition of his debut novel “Lenin,” published in 2024—a work that has drawn wide critical and readerly attention for its depth, originality, and philosophical intensity. The novel is a bold literary reimagining of the life and ideas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin, crafted through nearly six years of meticulous research and sustained creative effort. Crossing geographical and generational boundaries, Lenin has found a strong readership among Bengali readers in Bangladesh, India, and North America, and has been widely discussed for its reflective engagement with history, ideology, and human struggle. In 2025, Md Ashanur Rahman further expanded his literary landscape with his first short story collection, “Bhor O Baruder Golpo,” a series of powerful narratives where dawn, conflict, memory, and hope intersect. The stories reveal a deep sensitivity to time and transformation, capturing the silent tensions of lives shaped by violence, resilience, and quiet endurance. Beyond his books, he remains actively engaged in the literary world. He is a co-editor of Mononrekha, a half-yearly literary magazine, and Lekhālekhir Uthān, a web-based platform dedicated to art, literature, and culture. His essays and reflections on literature are regularly published in leading national dailies, including Daily Prothom Alo, Daily Banik Barta and Daily Samakal, where his thoughtful voice continues to contribute to contemporary literary discourse. Alongside his literary pursuits, Md Ashanur Rahman is a senior banking professional with over two decades of experience and currently serves as deputy managing director, chief economist, and country business manager of City Bank PLC. Despite the demands of his professional life, he writes with unwavering dedication—often in moments borrowed from routine—guided by a belief that literature is not a luxury, but a moral responsibility. In his personal life, he draws strength and meaning from his family—his wife and two daughters—whose presence anchors both his silences and his words. The International Creative Arts Award 2025 celebrates not only the success of Lenin as a novel, but also a literary journey that bridges discipline and imagination, affirming that enduring stories can emerge even from the most unlikely worlds.",

While there remain numerous pressing challenges for our nation, and indeed new ones that are sure to emerge over the coming months that are more visible and tangible, the urgency of tackling air pollution and environmental degradation cannot be overstated. The new year has begun with a steady increase when it comes to toxic air, with the capital city continuing to rank among the most polluted cities globally. Air pollution has long been a public health crisis for the country, but it should also be seen as a national emergency that threatens not just the health of every single person within but also our economic output and social stability. With all political parties pledging their agendas, the question is no longer whether addressing our toxic air quality issues should be part of these agendas but rather the urgency with which they must be addressed. As Bangladesh looks to rebuild better as a nation, regardless of the political party and leaders at the helm, we expect them to rise above rhetoric and commit to enforceable policies for cleaner air for the people of Bangladesh to breathe. From expansion of better public transport to urban planning that prioritizes sustainable living to investment in clean energy sources, these are steps that must be taken sooner rather than later. As we look to the future, let us ensure that progress is measured not only in GDP growth or infrastructure. It is time for all of us to recognize that the right to clean air is inseparable from the right to life, and that a better Bangladesh begins with better, breathable air.",

Indeed, during the election season in particular, but also at all times, the press must be allowed to perform its duty -- without intimidation, censorship, or undue interference. This responsibility also extends to the owners of these establishments, which is where we wholeheartedly agree with Nurul Kabir, President of the Editors’ Council and Mahfuz Anam, Editor of the Daily Star when they spoke at the first Media Convention held yesterday. Both men rightfully remarked that an attempt to turn the media into a purely business-driven industry would ultimately destroy public trust and democratic values, and that without collective courage and solidarity within the media itself, it was impossible to defend freedom of expression against increasingly difficult challenges. However, ultimately, it is the state that must also create the environment for the media to thrive and hold those in power accountable. In Bangladesh’s history, we have unfortunately repeatedly seen an environment of intimidation and repression when it comes to the media - one that, with the elections and a newly elected government, we must finally begin to turn around. It bears repeating that the media, when allowed to do its job, will always be an asset to any state and any society.

    "title": "The tax is too high",
    "body": "If people refuse to pay taxes, then we've a useful indication that the tax rate is too high. It's not conclusive proof, this tax strike, but it is still useful information. If people smuggle and then dodge import taxation, then this is useful information that import taxes are too high. That's a useful starting point from which to think about the complaint from the Mobile Phone Industry Owners Association. According to them, at least some 20% of high-end phones sold in the country are smuggled across borders -- or, at best, are part of the “grey” industry (in the jargon, “black” market is illegal things, grey is legal but not paying tax). We can see how this might be true, too, as there's a 43% tax on the import of decent smartphones. This then leads to loss of tax revenue amounting to about Tk10,000 crore. And, well, yes, OK, we can see their point. They are the people obeying the law and then these other people just flaunt that law and make money by not paying taxes. We can see why they'd be upset. On the other hand, we need to think about the existence of the 43% tax in the first place. Is this actually a sensible idea? That 20% of the market simply ignores the very idea itself would indicate that perhaps that tax rate is too high. But if it is, then why do we have it at all? Ah, well, that's because the people who make phones -- OK, high-end smartphones -- in Bangladesh are much more expensive than people outside Bangladesh. The government thinks that making phones here is a good idea so those imports should be heavily taxed therefore. The government is wrong on this. There is no good reason why phones should be made in Bangladesh. Therefore we should not protect -- with these import tariffs -- the companies that try to do that. Now, I admit that I'm an extremist in matters of trade so you could dismiss my views on that basis. But economists desperately insist upon a difference between intermediate goods and final consumption goods. Intermediates are those that are then used to make other things, and the general insistence is that import taxes and duties upon them are a really, really, bad idea. Because if we push up the price of the things we make things from, then we push up the costs of those things being made. And those things being made from the imports might well be worth very much more than either the tax revenue being collected from the imports or whatever might be the value of the domestic production of those intermediate goods. Which is where we are with smartphones. They're the very foundation of “Digital Bangladesh” -- we're not going to do that on personal computers for everyone, this is something that's going to happen on phones. We all also know that the whole country going digital is one of those things that is going to enrich us all. Hugely and vastly enrich us all. So, we want smartphones -- the intermediate good -- to be as cheap as possible. We really want smartphones to be as cheap as possible, they're the tool that will enable us to meet that larger goal of an efficient society all around us. Manufacturing them in Bangladesh, well, if they're cheap then that's great. If they're expensive then we want to buy them from foreigners. Because we want cheap smartphones much more than we want either tax revenue or a few jobs. We also know that Bangladesh-made smartphones are expensive which is why there is a 43% tax upon imports -- if there was no such tax, there would be no domestic production. That people dodge the 43% tax tells us that the tax is too high anyway. But taxing cheaper methods of gaining an intermediate technology like smartphones is a silly thing to do anyway. So, the correct thing to do is abolish the import tax. Not that anyone will but that is what should be done. People dodging taxes is an indication -- it's information. But sometimes the correct answer from consideration of that data is to abolish the tax.",

    "title": "When the pitch becomes a powder keg",
    "body": "International cricket has weathered many storms throughout its history, navigating political tensions, security threats, and diplomatic standoffs. However, the unfolding crisis surrounding Bangladesh’s participation in the 2026 T20 World Cup represents something unprecedented: A situation where the International Cricket Council (ICC) appears to be asking a nation to send its cricketers, officials, journalists, and supporters into an environment that carries substantial risks. So far, the concerns centre on Kolkata, where Bangladesh is scheduled to play three of their group matches. Yet this is not merely about cricket venues or match logistics. Instead, the question has become a crucible where multiple combustible elements converge: A diplomatic freeze between two neighbouring nations, systematic visa restrictions, and the presence of exiled Awami League leaders and activists in Kolkata who harbour openly stated ambitions to destabilize Bangladesh’s current government. If India’s own cricket board, with all its resources and influence, felt unable or unwilling to guarantee the security of Mustafizur Rahman against pressure from BJP politicians who celebrated his removal as “a victory for Hindus across the whole country,” then how could Bangladesh trust that adequate protection would be provided for an entire national team? The answer, articulated clearly by Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul, is that they can’t. His statement that Bangladesh would not play the T20 World Cup 2026 on Indian soil while “compromising the security and dignity of its cricketers, spectators, and journalists” represents not diplomatic posturing but a fundamental assessment of risk that should concern anyone who cares about cricket’s future as a truly international sport. Acknowledging risks while minimizing responsibilities ICC’s security assessment stated that “the assessed risk to Bangladeshi nationals and supporters attending fixtures” in Kolkata would be “moderately high, particularly those wearing team colours and travelling in isolated groups to the stadium.” This is not speculation from Bangladeshi officials. The report further notes that the presence of Mustafizur Rahman “may be problematic if religious extremism becomes kinetically engaged” -- bureaucratic language that translates to a very real possibility of violence. Nevertheless, despite these acknowledged risks, the ICC’s conclusion remains that “the risk associated with Bangladesh’s scheduled fixtures in Kolkata and Mumbai is assessed as low, with no indication of risks that cannot be effectively managed through security planning.” The question that must be asked is: Managed how, exactly? The assessment identifies the threats but offers no concrete roadmap for mitigation beyond generic references to “security planning.” Cricket without supporters is not cricket The diplomatic deadlock between Bangladesh and India since August 2024, has led to systematic visa restrictions that would effectively prevent Bangladeshi supporters from travelling to India for the World Cup matches. Imagine a cricket match where the Bangladesh national team plays against opponents in Kolkata’s iconic Eden Gardens stadium with no Bangladeshi supporter in attendance. The image is jarring because it violates something fundamental about international cricket: The sport thrives on the passionate support of fans who travel across borders, wave flags, sing songs, and create the atmosphere that transforms cricket from a game into a cultural phenomenon. Equally, journalists covering Bangladesh’s World Cup campaign would face uncertain visa prospects. Cricket sponsors who need to attend matches for commercial obligations may be denied entry. Government officials who would normally accompany national teams for diplomatic protocol could be turned away. Additionally, even if some Bangladeshi nationals managed to secure visas, their safety once in India remains questionable. Recent reports indicate that hotels in various Indian cities have refused accommodation to Bangladeshi citizens, citing pretexts. How can a supporter plan to travel to India to enjoy a cricket match when basic accommodation cannot be guaranteed? What makes Kolkata particularly problematic as a venue for Bangladesh’s matches is not merely general political tensions but the specific concentration of exiled Awami League leadership in the city. According to investigative reporting by The Print, approximately 1,300 Awami League leaders, supporters, and affiliated individuals have established themselves in Kolkata, primarily in the New Town area, since Sheikh Hasina's departure from Bangladesh in August 2024. These are not passive refugees seeking shelter but politically active individuals who maintain an organizational structure, hold regular meetings, and explicitly state their goal of returning to power in Bangladesh. The presence includes senior figures such as former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who maintains a spacious apartment in New Town where he “entertains regular visitors -- his party colleagues” and travels weekly to Delhi for party meetings and consultations with “high-level functionaries of the Indian establishment.” This is not speculation but documented reporting from credible Indian media outlets. Bangladesh is expected to hold elections on February 12, 2026, just days after the T20 World Cup begins on February 7, 2026. During this sensitive electoral period, the national cricket team would be in a city where political opponents maintain an active, organized presence. While there is no evidence of specific plots against cricketers, the volatile combination of elements creates an environment where security cannot be assured with confidence. Security planning can’t override political reality The ICC’s position essentially asks Bangladesh to trust that “security planning” can overcome deeply rooted political animosity, religious extremism in mainstream politics, diplomatic hostility, and the presence of political opponents actively working to destabilize their government. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of what security means in the context of international cricket. Let’s consider a few practical scenarios that could unfold. Bangladeshi journalists attempting to cover matches might encounter exiled Awami League supporters at restaurants, shopping areas, or transportation hubs in Kolkata. Sports ministry officials accompanying the team could face confrontations from those who view the current Bangladesh government as illegitimate. Cricket sponsors in Kolkata might find themselves navigating an environment where their national identity marks them as targets for harassment. How can security forces prevent all possible confrontations between Bangladeshi cricket fans and hostile elements in a city of millions? How can they guarantee safety for journalists working outside the controlled environment of stadiums? The answer is that they can’t, which is precisely why Bangladesh’s concerns can’t be dismissed as mere diplomatic posturing. When a full ICC member nation presents evidence-backed security concerns, the governing body’s own security assessment can’t be a bureaucratic dismissal or appeals to logistical convenience. The ball is now in the ICC’s court. The governing body faces a choice between upholding the principles of safety and setting a dangerous precedent that security concerns can be dismissed when they conflict with logistical convenience. For Bangladesh, the position is clear: Kolkata, with all its cricketing history and iconic venues, has become a place where the pitch can’t be separated from the powder keg.

Let us help the nation get rid of the political disunity and dispute,” fbcci President Kazi Akram Uddin Ahmed said at a meeting with editors and heads of newspapers, television channels and news agencies at Dhaka Club. He said the government will have to be sincere in addressing the logical demands of the opposition while the opposition needs to refrain from calling hartal. “All problems should be resolved through dialogue.” Akram said the nation will remember their contributions towards resolving the political crisis peacefully if the political parties sincerely act to that end. “We expect a coordinated effort to establish a country having political and economic stability. We want to increase investment both in private and public sectors to see a higher economic growth,” he said. The fbcci president expressed hope that the media would play a vital role in helping the political parties reach a consensus.

    "body": "Asian stock markets were mixed Friday as investors turned cautious and took profits from recent rallies in spite of evidence pointing to an improving U.S. employment picture. Japan's Nikkei 225 index retreated 0.8 percent to 13,440.44, slipping from the day before, when the Toyko benchmark closed above 13,500 for the first time since August 2008. The Nikkei has been riding high on the Bank of Japan's aggressive new approach to jolting the world's third-largest economy out of a prolonged slump. Evan Lucas of IG Markets in Melbourne said profit-taking was putting pressure on Australia's resource-heavy benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index, which rose 0.1 percent to 5,012.70. \"This will unfortunately dampen what has otherwise being a solid week for the local market, and may see stronger downside pressure in the afternoon as it is the end of the week and investors will close up positions,\" he said in a commentary. BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining company, fell 0.7 percent. Rio Tinto Ltd. dropped 2.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2 percent to 22,155.17. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,942.45. Wall Street stocks ended higher after major retailers such as Rite Aid surged after turning in better sales and weekly claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped. Investors were awaiting JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. quarterly results later in the day. Also due Friday are reports from the U.S. Commerce Department on retail sales data for March and business inventories for February. Among individual stocks, Woodside Petroleum Ltd. rose 2.8 percent after the Australian energy company said it has shelved a proposed 45 billion Australian dollar ($47 billion) liquefied natural gas plant in northwestern Australia. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 14,865.14. The S&P 500 index rose 0.4 percent to 1,593.37. The Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.1 percent to 3,300.16. Benchmark oil for May delivery was down 22 cents to $93.29 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The euro rose to $1.3117 from $1.3112 late Thursday in New York.

The decision came when the newly elected governing body of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) called on the central bank governor, Dr Atiur Rahman, at his office. The joint-committee will also work on the moderation of the loan classification and provisioning restrictions imposed earlier by the central bank, BGMEA president M Atiqul Islam told reporters after the meeting with the BB governor. He said that in the meeting, the BGMEA leaders expressed concern over the apathy the commercial banks have been showing to the readymade garment (RMG) owners since the Hallmark scam was exposed. Atiqul Islam said: “We also demanded the withdrawal of the recently imposed instruction on loan classification and provisioning that was issued by the central bank.” The BB governor has agreed to cancel the instruction requiring a continuous loan to be classified for non-repayment within three months, he informed. “I assure the RMG owners that the previous timeframe of six months will be restored for loan classification,” the BGMEA president said. BB executive director SM Moniruzzaman and BGMEA vice president Nasir Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury are primarily nominated as the members of the joint-monitoring committee.",

    "body": "Toyota, Honda and Nissan are recalling more than 2 million vehicles globally for an identical problem with air bags on the passenger side whose inflator may burst, sending plastic pieces flying. No injuries have been reported related to the problem. The recall for air bags made by Japan's Takata Corp. affects other automakers, including non-Japanese manufacturers, Takata spokesman Akiko Watanabe said Thursday. She declined to give details. Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 1.7 million vehicles, with some 580,000 in North America, another 490,000 in Europe and 320,000 in Japan. Affected models include the Corolla, Tundra, Lexus SC, produced between November 2000 and March 2004. Toyota said it had received five reports of air-bag problems, three in the U.S. and two in Japan, but there have been no injuries. Honda Motor Co. is recalling 1.1 million vehicles. About 680,000 are in North America, 270,000 in Japan and 64,000 in Europe. The models include the Civic, CR-V and Odyssey. The automakers have reported the problem to the Transport Ministry in Japan, and will be reporting other recalls later in the day in other regions, they said. The recall extends to Latin America, China, other Asian nations, the Middle East and Africa. Nissan Motor Co. recalled 480,000 vehicles globally, some 137,000 of them in Japan, for the air bag problem. The Yokohama-based automaker said vehicles in North America and Europe are affected, but did not immediately have other details on its 343,000 overseas recalls. Recalled models in Japan include the Cube, X-Trail, Maxima and Teana, made from August 2000, to January 2004, spokesman Chris Keeffe said. The problem crept in because of two human errors during production. A worker forgot to turn on the switch for a system weeding out defective products and parts were improperly stored, which exposed them to humidity, according to Honda spokeswoman Akemi Ando.",

The deceased was identified as transport businessman M Ali Jinna, 62, a resident of the Baroachra village of Benapole. The police said an Indian jute-laden truck ran over Jinna at the export terminal centre at about 8am while he was returning home from his morning walk, leaving him dead on the spot. Locals later caught the truck, the indiv who was driving the vehicle at the time, managed to escape. The truck was handed over to local police. Workers at the port also halted the India-bound Bangladeshi trucks carrying goods protesting the killing and demanding an exemplary punishment to the driver, disrupting the export of Bangladeshi goods to India through the country’s biggest land port for about two hours from 9am. The deadlock came to an end two hours later following an intervention by local businessmen. However, import activities through the port were normal.",

    "title": "No to sadistic corporal punishment!",
    "body": "The government has done away with corporal punishment in schools, yet there are still reported incidents of cruel and even sadistic punishment. On April 9, the headmaster of the Nurainpur Primary School in Patuakhali beat several Class V students and had them clean the blackboard with their tongues, of all things. Why such a disgusting action on his part? Because the students had written slogans on the board in support of their teacher, which the headmaster thought inappropriate. And on April 3, a nine-year-old primary school student in Barisal attempted suicide in fear of corporal punishment and died soon after from the attempt. This is outrageous. School authorities are responsible for the safety of the children who attend their schools. To cross all lines of decency and morality just to make a point is beyond offensive. It’s unacceptable. As for the young boy in Barisal, imagine how terrified he must have been of corporal punishment that he would rather kill himself than put himself through that torture. And torture is what it is. The thing is, assault and disrespect for the human body and human space are such an innate part of Bangladeshi culture that no one gives a second thought to hitting a servant, a spouse, or a child. Rickshaw drivers get hit all the time by law enforcement officers. In fact, anyone on a lower economic rung is fair game. Such an ingrained mindset is very difficult to change, as the common belief is that beating up people is okay, and even acceptable, when the opposite is true. Steps were taken to prevent excesses of assault and punishment in schools. After many such instances came to light, a High Court ruling on Jan 13, 2011 declared corporal punishment to be unconstitutional, followed by a government guideline that did away with it at all levels of education, from primary schools to university, and including madrasas. This man, however, has blatantly flouted the law, not to mention common decency, and needs to be punished. Moreover, an example must be made of him so he can never harm another child and no one else dares to contemplate stooping that low.",

    "body": "The time is ripe to select a non-partisan candidate as president of Bangladesh. With the death of former president Zillur Rahman, with Speaker Abdul Hamid carrying on his duties as acting president, the next parliamentary session set to begin on April 21, and only 90 days in which to elect a new head of state, setting the deadline at June 21, the opportunity is at hand for our parliamentarians to keep away from traditional practices, in particular that of selecting someone from the ruling party, and opt for a neutral president who would be better able to work with all of the parties on an equal footing. An independent candidate would be better able to steer clear of partisan politics, and thus would be more acceptable to the general public. After all, the president is the representative of the entire nation, not merely the ruling party, and the prime minister already holds the post of leader of the ruling party. Bear in mind that some of our former presidents were chief justices as well. There was Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, who held the post from November 1975 to April 1977, Shahabuddin Ahmed, who was president from December 1990 to October 1991, and Justice AFM Ahsanuddin Chowdhury (March 1982 to December 1983). The names of several candidates are being discussed. However, of all the candidates under consideration, Prof Anisuzzaman would perhaps be best suited as head of state. Not to denigrate any of the other very worthy names under consideration but, as he is not of the ruling party, nor the opposition, he would be able to ensure non-partisanship and a neutral and just voice to speak for the people. It would make for a nice and welcome change.",

The export earnings totaled US$ 3,471.48 million (m) during July-Feb of current fiscal (2012-13) compared to $ 3,315.73 m during the same period of the previous year (2011-12). The amount represents 19.95 percent of the country’s total export earnings during the period. According to recent statistics compiled by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), RMG export, including knitwear, to the US amounted to $ 3,186.03 m during the July-Feb period of the current fiscal compared to $ 2,977.32 m during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. The RMG items, including knitwear, witnessed a 7.01 percent growth in the US market. The major exports to the US market during the period were woven garment ($ 2,468.99 m), knitwear ($ 717.04 m), frozen shrimp ($ 26.87 m), home textiles ($ 124.72 m) and cap ($ 24.76 m). During the period, around 34.78 percent of the country’s total woven garment exports entered the US market, followed by knitwear 10.65 percent and frozen shrimp 8.74 percent. Bangladesh’s export earnings from the US in fiscal 2010-11 were impressive as it totaled $ 5107.52 m showing a 29.29 percent gain over that of fiscal 2009-10. The export earnings in fiscal 2009-10, however, totaled US$ 3.14 billion (bn), a 7.74 percent fall over $ 3.4 bn in 2008-09, mostly because of the global economic recession. The RMG export, including knitwear, witnessed a sharp fall of over 6 percent in fiscal 2009-10, fetching $ 2.9 bn as against $ 3.1 bn in 2008-09. The 2009-10 fiscal marked the end of an ups-and-down period for Bangladesh exports to the US. From the robust $2.5 bn during the 2000-01 fiscal, exports had fallen below $ 2 bn by 2003-04. Exports rose steadily to cross the $ 3-bn mark in 2005-06, and peaked at nearly $ 3.6 bn during the 2007-08 fiscal.",

    "title": "Gold claws back losses after biggest fall in 30 years",
    "body": "Gold prices clawed back some losses today after suffering their heaviest slump in 30 years triggered by weak Chinese growth data and reports Cyprus was planning to sell part of its reserves. Analysts said the 13 percent drop in prices between Friday's open and Monday's close could show gold's 12-year bull-run was at an end, with investors turning away from the metal, which is traditionally a hedge against inflation. At 0535 GMT in Asia, an ounce of gold cost $1,360.99. The commodity enjoyed a lift after sinking to as low as $1,338.00 at one point in New York on Monday -- a 10.9 percent fall and its sharpest slump since 1983. Investors were spooked after China released data Monday showing growth in the world's number two economy had slowed in the first quarter to 7.7 percent, below forecasts and indicating a recent pick-up remained fragile. The news also hit equity markets, while other commodities also tumbled, with the May contract for Brent crude falling below $100 a barrel for the first time since July. China is a huge importer of oil to drive its vast economy. \"It's the speed of it and the extent of the sell-off that shocked everybody,\" Kelly Teoh, a market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, told AFP. \"For the rest of the week it's going to look quite bearish.\" The longer-term view is that with inflation expectations still flat -- as US and Chinese data indicate -- people who buy gold as a hedge against rising prices have been driven to dump bullion. \"Gold has had a 12-year run. It's done really well. But if you're holding a position and you're seeing you're getting a better yield in the cash markets it's a natural move,\" said Teoh. Adding to unease were reports last week that the central bank in Cyprus is looking at selling some of its 14 tonnes of gold to help pay for a bailout agreed with the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Joyce Liu, investment Analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, said such a move fuelled concerns that other troubled countries could follow suit as they struggle with ongoing debt woes. Liu also said traders were likely moving out of the precious metal, which is seen as a safe bet in times of economic uncertainty, as the US recovery picks up and the eurozone crisis eases. In Hong Kong, jeweller Amy Lee said buyers who had rushed to buy gold after Friday's losses had cooled off on Tuesday as they wait for prices to fall further.",

    "title": "The Starvation Raj",
    "body": "Today, 94 years ago, India finally abandoned any hope of living in peace with the British Raj. When British guns blazed frenetically in Punjab shedding blood in the holy city of Amritsar, our awkward, abusive marriage was well and truly over. But the horrendous violence that was wrought upon unarmed villagers on the 13th of April 1919, assembled at the Bagh mainly for Baishakhi and quite unaware of the curfew in place, isn’t the actual crime though. The killing and injuring of hundreds even thousands of men, women and children; the firing without warning straight into the crowd and then into the thickest part of it when it broke up and people ran in a complete panic towards absent exits - to be crushed underfoot or against walls; the shooting continuously until they ran out of ammunition, executing people wholesale and then leaving them there in piles of bodies, to die, if they weren’t already dead, of their injuries; the utter and deliberate disregard for human life and for humanity itself – these aren’t the real crimes. The real horror is in the way that this act of terrorism (by Churchill’s own admission) was applauded by large sections of British society, both in India and in the UK. In the clubs across India, in the homes, barracks, and offices, prim, polite Englishmen and Englishwomen were sipping drinks served by their ‘native servants’ and celebrating the temporarily ranked Brigadier-General Dyer’s firm handedness in dealing with these local upstarts, who had had the cheek to confront British authority or worse, challenge white man’s unquestionable right to bear his ‘burden’. Surely these Indians would think again now. They certainly were thinking again. Thinking again why 43,000 Indians died fighting for Britain in the first World War, why Indian politicians remained loyal to the UK, assuaging fears that we would use this opportunity to revolt while they were committed militarily in Europe. We were also thinking again about why nearly 1.25 million Indian soldiers and labourers served the war effort, and why our independent princes sent food, money, and ammunition of their own accord, to help Britain in her time of need. But mostly we were thinking again about why we ever expected the British to honour their agreement of reforms in exchange for assistance, and give Indians more legislative liberty once the war was over. But what happened in Amritsar even shocked Winston Churchill – then Secretary of State for War, who said, \"It is an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation\" Dyer was relieved of command and forced to retire, but he was never punished and enjoyed the support of many higher officials, including the Army Council and the Deputy-Governor of Punjab Micheal O’ Dwyer – who formally congratulated him. In fact nothing at all might have happened to him, had it not been for Lord William Hunter, who relied on his conscience and not on popular sentiment to deliver his judgement - sentiment that was echoed in the House of Lords, and even, sadly, by Rudyard Kipling who started a fund for General Dyer as recompense for his loss of pension. Truth is, the British Empire in India was a particularly ignoble endeavour, and there was nothing at all isolated about that sinister, monstrous event. In fact just two days later, on the 15th of April, another gathering at Gujaranwala, protesting the massacre at Amritsar, was set upon by the British, this time with aeroplanes and machine guns, killing 12 more people including children. Indians were routinely subjected to all manner of violence, from being publicly flogged, to being tied to the mouths of cannons and blown to bits. Summary executions were common, so was torture and exile. And of course apart from the physical violence, there were the psychological and the economic ones as well. In 1943, three million Bengalis died slowly of starvation, because Churchill didn’t think it worth his while to send food to them. In fact the frequency and intensity of famines during British rule in India was consistently higher on both counts than it had ever been in years prior, or has been since. So callous was Britain’s attitude towards the loss of life in India that when Florence Nightingale put out a series of publications during the late 1800’s with the hope of educating the British public about the human cost of their luxuriant Empire, it had little effect. Before the British arrived, famines occurred mostly in drier parts around Delhi and Sindh, not in fertile and agriculturally endowed areas like Bengal or South India. Yet in British times these are exactly where they happened, resulting in extermination on a scale that makes the Nazis look like sloppy amateurs. A staggering number of people were allowed to die. Each famine killed millions – nearly 10 million in the Great Famine of 1876-78, and ten years before that in 1866, nearly a third of the population of Orissa at the time. Various theories exist about why this was the case, but the general consensus seems to be that it includes the following: land usage for industrial crops like indigo, jute and cotton at the expense of food grain and livestock, the commoditisation of grain, export agriculture for foreign revenue with little thought about domestic subsistence, inadequate transportation, heavy taxation, ridiculously low wages, a redirection of resources towards military spending and British upkeep, a conspicuous absence of any accountability or system of representation for Indians and more tellingly, an absolute lack of care for Indian life. Even when decent men like the writer William Digby who witnessed the tragedy of 1876 first-hand, insisted that there be some policy change or some sort of famine relief, he was defeated by the Viceroy’s pompous assumption that it would only make the Indian workers lazy - ‘demoralisation’, I think is what he called it. I suppose it offended his principles less to exploit them thoroughly, before starving them to death. Around the same time that Indians were experiencing an agonising and skeletal demise, this celebrated and Right Honourable Earl of a diplomat, held a banquet for almost 60,000 guests, while exported tons of rice and grain to the UK and the USA as part of a policy of non-interference with free trade – England’s lifeblood, siphoned off from the varicose veins of an atrophying India. No one sums it up better than the American scholar Mike Davis who calls the famines ‘late Victorian Holocausts’, and says, \"Millions died, not outside the 'modern world system', but in the very process of being forcibly incorporated into its economic and political structures. They died in the golden age of Liberal Capitalism; indeed, many were murdered ... by the theological application of the sacred principles of Smith, Bentham and Mill.\" Far from being a well-ordered example of British administrative prowess, and without much of a ‘civilising mission’ anywhere in sight, the Raj was in fact a shabby and mismanaged disgrace, excelling only at dispassionate plunder cleverly disguised as government. Bengal, for instance, with all its wealth and abundance, whose people had never before experienced such acute want, were robbed to the point of being beggared, copping it badly on both ends – at the start of British occupation and at the finish. In 1770, only 13 yrs after the British orchestrated a regime change in Murshidabad, the richest province of the Mughal realm experienced a famine so severe that a third of the population, possibly 10 million people, perished in only 10 months. And as a parting gift, just 5 years before they left, while Hitler was putting into place his ‘final solution’ for the Jews, Churchill cut off supplies of rice and other staples to Bengal to deprive the Japanese Army of sustenance, should they break through the Eastern gate after the fall of Myanmar. This ‘scorched earth’ policy was among other disastrous strategies concocted by the British government to protect all sorts of priorities in India, none of which were the lives of Indians, who were instead slaughtered by the millions at the alter of administrative oversight. To put things into perspective, since the British left there hasn’t been another famine of such unconscionable proportions anywhere in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. Ever. The 1878 famine had, as one might expect, a profound and permanent impact on Indian affairs. It led to the end of the Raj in fact. British civil servants in India like William Wedderburn and A.O. Hume distraught by how the Government in India regarded Indians as little more than disposable labour, and India’s first political leader the formidable Bal Gangadhar Tilak as well as Gopal Krishna Gokhale joined forces to form the Indian National Congress, less than a decade later in 1885. The rest is history, or rather, the present, as the Congress party is still going strong and is to date the most successful horse in the Indian race. In April 1919, Amritsar became the tipping point in our struggle for Freedom. Kobiguru Robindronath Thakur returned his knighthood, the slogans gradually changed from “Home Rule’ to ‘Quit India’, and Gandhiji was finally incensed enough to see the futility of believing there could ever be a relationship of two adults between the UK and India. The chord was cut. Dominion status would not longer do and only full independence was acceptable. Britain would have to be forced to stand entirely on its own feet; it would have to be weaned completely off the effusive Indian tit on which it had grown so very fat.",

    "body": "The fact that MPs of rival parties have come to an agreement about the fundamentals of an anti-hartal bill bodes well for bipartisanship in our nation. This bill, if it came to pass, would make enforcing consecutive hartals a criminal offence, and those who commit such an offence would be tried under the Penal Code. It’s a relief to see that members of opposite parties can sit together and come to an understanding on something. A rare occurrence but most welcome. The recent sponsorship of an anti-hartal bill by members from both the ruling and opposition parties certainly makes sense. And starting a dialogue and seeking non-partisan support is a good way to get the ball rolling towards ending the frequency of hartals that we have seen over the years. What’s more, the public’s concerns have been taken into account here as most people are fed up with hartals. According to a UNDP report, the highest number of hartals stands at 173, called between 2001 and 2006 when the AL was in opposition. At the least, an anti-hartal measure would make it difficult for the party calling one to enforce it, especially if the people were to reject it outright. If Sheikh Hasina and the AL want to be taken seriously, then throwing their weight behind an anti-hartal bill is the way to go. The leaders of both parties have been welcomed to take part in the discussion, and they would do well to throw their hat in with this initiative. Though we can’t expect both parties to unilaterally agree on this measure, this is a good initiative that could go a long way toward ending the stalemate between the two parties and do away with the hartal culture altogether.",

The headlines blare of increasingly frequent and brutal attacks on the police, who are only doing what they were hired to do – catching the bad guys, bringing them to justice, and protecting the public – but continue to be grossly outmanned and outgunned by the vicious maelstrom that is Jamaat and Shibir. Because of this terrorising aspect, the government needs to take a strong line in support of law enforcement. Notwithstanding the bad seeds among police officers, their corrupt activities, or our proclivity for railing against them, the fact remains that not everyone in law enforcement is corrupt. Most officers are merely trying to do their job under very difficult circumstances but are paid a mere pittance for it. All the more reason for the government to stand in support of its law enforcement officers. In January, the public were besieged by images and reports of Jamaat and Shibir shooting at police, and hurling grenades at them, while the officers, grossly outnumbered, folded in the attacks. Recent reports are in a similar vein, though more intense. Note the audacity of Shibir in assaulting an officer, snatching his rifle, helmet and walkie-talkie, and then beating him with sticks and bricks after the officer lost consciousness, and this in a clash in Rajshahi on Monday morning. One of many clashes that have taken place thus far. This is an escalation of the violence Jamaat and Shibir have unleashed, and the government must take a tougher stance. Bear in mind that these officers are the only ones preventing Jamaat and Shibir from having their way and causing utter pandemonium, something the government cannot, and must not allow to happen at any cost.",

    "body": "That Petrobangla only received two bids from international oil companies (IOCs), for further exploration of potential sources of oil and gas, is a stark reminder that the country must do significantly more in order to attract foreign investment. Current gas reserves that provide fuel for over 70% of all power generation activities are being depleted exponentially. At present, from local sources, gas-based power generation receives gas at a price far lower than the regional market value. If more gas is not discovered soon, the country will have to look to other primary energy sources, most of which will have to be imported at great cost. This makes it more important than ever that we are able to properly exploit the natural resources we may be sitting on. Our future energy security, and, consequently, the extent of our economic/industrial growth may depend on it. That being said, the government must do all in its power to make the country a more attractive place in which to invest. A recent study by the World Bank ranks Bangladesh as 129 out of a study that includes 185 countries with regards to ease of doing business. The ranking represents why so few large companies are willing to invest much-needed capital. The steps that should be taken in the short run include increasing the transparency of bidding procedures, doing away with bureaucratic red tape and providing further financial incentives for those who may be willing to invest – possibly by going so far as to raise the price at which gas is supplied to local power generation and industry. These initial steps would be a good way to assuage the fears of international organisations and protect Bangladesh’s economic outlook in the long run.",

At a time when other nations are starting to pull back their military forces, and the war-ravaged nation is in dire need of assistance and expertise, Bangladesh has made a gracious move. Plans are in place to send its retired and serving defence officials who have prior UN experience, as well as expert female police trainers, who will guide and train the Afghan female police officers. These plans also include Bangladesh sharing its hard-earned experience in agriculture, social welfare, women empowerment, health, and primary education. This is nothing new for our nation, which has a history of sending troops and law enforcement officers overseas to aid in defence and in rebuilding efforts. The first nation to send troops in 1991, as part of the UN coalition, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bangladesh has also sent police forces to Bosnia, as part of UN peace-keeping efforts, as well as elsewhere. This move by the government will not only boost regional cooperation, but also put this nation in a positive light before the world. Considering that its image has always been of a flood-ravaged poverty-stricken nation, and, recently, strife-ridden as well, no thanks to the political violence, this move comes at a good time.",

    "body": "It’s becoming increasingly apparent that the Islamists are setting the agenda in Bangladesh. Parties, the government and even the Gonojagoron Moncho are falling over themselves trying to appease the religious right and its latest incarnation, the Hefazat-e-Islam. In what looks like a complete U-turn, the government has arrested bloggers they once patronised,seemingly agreeing with the rhetoric that they are an insidious force determined to insult Islam. Arrests on the grounds of offending religious sentiment isn’t unusual, considering we have a legal system that allows it. Section 295(A) of Bangladesh’s Penal Code makes it illegal to deliberately and maliciously hurt someone else’s religious sentiments. The law is in the interest of harmony and given the recent breaches in just that, it’s arguably a necessary evil. Trouble is, so far the evidence being offered to satisfy the conditions of “malicious” or “deliberate” or even, for that matter, of having “hurt religious sentiments” has been scant. The timing of the arrests raises more inconvenient questions. It happened straight after a group of clerics submitted a list of offensive blogs to the government, and Hefazat –e-Islam announced its April 6 Long March towards Dhaka to press, among other things, their demands for the capital punishment of “atheist bloggers.” The government appears to be cultivating an Islamic “alternative” to Jamaat-e-Islami, and to undercut its religion-based support by presenting itself as a “halal” party. It seems like a Band-Aid reaction to the anarchy we’re witnessing lately, but it may, in fact, widen the fissures that have opened up in Bangladeshi society. It also detracts from the real issue - the war crimes tribunal. Electoral math can produce strange bedfellows. But if the government is being held hostage to an Islamist version of reality, it bodes quite badly for secular Bangladesh.",

    "body": "As our national political pastime of calling hartals persists, the economy of the country continues to suffer. While everyone understands that a nationwide shutdown of economic activities causes significant fiscal and economic losses, the true extent of such has been largely unknown. A recent study carried out by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) has shed some light on the matter. The study paints a more dismal picture of the effects that hartals have on the economy than previously thought. It states that the annual loss, on average, is estimated at 6.5% of GDP. Simply put, hartals are to blame for Bangladesh’s inability to hit double-digit economic growth figures. In addition to the macroeconomic woes, the hardest hit sector is retail, which means that the middle and lower middle class portions of the population bear a disproportionate burden. This is to say nothing of the fiscal impacts upon inflows of foreign direct investment and the effects on the stock market of the political instability that hartals represent. This simply cannot continue. It is high time for the leaders in the government and opposition to come up with a better way to address the problems of the nation – ways that do not cripple the economy. The first step in this process would be to open up dialogue between the different factions. If they come to the negotiating table with an open mind, who knows what they may be able to achieve? Of course, this seems to be a pipe dream. In the meantime, the government must do all that it can to ensure that business activities can continue as normal and minimize the impacts of hartals. Increased security, normal functioning of government offices and maintaining regular bank operations would be a good start.",

The speeches are fiery, the crowd frenzied and the determination fierce. They have gathered people from madrassas and mosques across the country, at considerable cost, and leaders of various groups have been affirming their commitment to the purist Islamic ideology they all belong to. And they are calling, in no uncertain terms, for an entirely Sharia-compliant country. They demand a revamping of the education policy; of women’s rights; of minority rights; death for blasphemy; the banning of “free-mixing” and “foreign cultural influence” and for the constitution of Bangladesh to become more Islam-oriented than it already is. Given that, it’s baffling how mainstream opposition parties are lending them any support at all, let alone all the support they can give.

    "body": "How has the national rhetoric on hartals altered so ridiculously that they are now an acceptable means of protest? Note recent events, as a coalition of twenty-five cultural and analogous organisations, including the Sammilita Sangskritik Jote, Sector Commanders Forum, and Ekattorer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, called for a 24-hour nationwide shutdown from Friday evening to resist Hefazat-e-Islam’s long march towards Dhaka. And, yet, in the same speech in which Sammilita Sangskritik Jote president Nasiruddin Yousuf Bachchu, as coalition spokesman, made this announcement, he had the gall to spout, “We don’t believe in strikes.” What utter nonsense! How can these organisations not believe in hartals, but urge the public to support one? Bear in mind that the national rhetoric has thus far been anti-hartal. Headlines have blared of the destruction caused by hartals, and now there are numbers to back this rhetoric. The Gonojagoron Moncho and the public have spoken along the same lines, and the government has called out the BNP and Jamaat-Shibir to cease its activities as they latter called subsequent hartals to grind the nation to a halt. Herein lies the paradox, but first, recall how the Shahbag movement got started. In protest of the life-imprisonment sentence on Abdul Quader Molla, a group of bloggers started a peaceful sit-in movement that grew in momentum. Now, however, ludicrously enough, a group of freedom fighters, cultural activists, and non-believers of hartals, have called for a hartal, of all things, to protest a peaceful march? Pointless indeed, but counter-productive too, since the end result is that it raised the ire of both Hefazat-e-Islam and the Islami Oikka Jote. Both have issued threats of a series of nationwide shutdowns, starting Sunday April 7, if the strike is carried out. Enough is enough. When will these diabolical twists of events end?",

    "title": "Attacks on women unacceptable",
    "body": "Hefazat-e-Islam crossed all lines of decency when it carried out unprovoked and even malicious attacks on several women. During their grand rally on Saturday, Hefazat members not only prevented women from entering the rally area, they assaulted several female journalists who were merely trying to go to work and do their jobs. Not even a group of garbage collectors, who were only trying to earn their daily bread, escaped the wrath of Hefazat. In Bijoynagar, the Hefazat activists threw brickbats and water bottles at Ekushey TV reporter Nadia Sharmin, stole her mobile and handbag, and then beat her up. Even after making her escape and taking shelter in a car, she was pursued and the car vandalised. Arafat Ara, a reporter with the Financial Express, was stopped from going to her office in Paltan merely because she was not wearing a scarf. A day earlier, Mohona TV chief reporter Sumi Khan had also been stopped en route to work. This is offensive and unacceptable, and, equally to the point, un-Islamic. Women have worked hard and made great strides to move Bangladesh forward, and their efforts should be commended. Yet, the Hefazat activists don’t even understand that much. In fact, they don’t care. They claim to be followers of Islam, a religion that teaches peace, tolerance and respect for all, whether they are believers or not, yet they go out of their way to harass, attack, and even rob women. This is so far off from the tenets of Islam, it’s outrageous. Now, there are many conservative Muslims in our country who are worried that their Islamic way of life is under attack, and they have a right to voice their concerns. Be that as it may, this hardly means they have the right to disrespect and assault women. It’s un-Islamic and absolutely non-negotiable.",

    "title": "The war on taxes",
    "body": "While most of the recommendations made by the DCCI to the NBR as they contribute to the new budget are sound, the concerned agencies should ignore the request to slap higher import duties on finished goods in the name of protecting infant industries. By and large, the main missive put forth is that the tax bracket in Bangladesh should be extended. In a country of 160 million, it is ludicrous that only 1.4 million pay income taxes. Instead of focusing on increasing the rates, they should bring more able people under the tax umbrella to ensure that the government still receives some much-needed revenue. The other points made would also, in general terms, boost our industrial sector. What the government should take issue with, is the proposal that import duties on finished goods should be raised. While the infant industry argument is understood, historical precedent shows us that the ideal is not easily applied. Instead of giving local industries the time they need to develop and gain economies of scale, protectionist measures instead shield inefficient local businesses and allow them to become lethargic – the burden is ultimately borne by the local consumers. On the other hand, if the government were to lower or do away with import duties, it would force local industry to adhere to best practices and improve efficiency to remain competitive. While the DCCI may argue that it is impossible for local business to compete internationally without some protection, we have plenty examples of businesses that have done just that. The members of the DCCI should focus on making their businesses better, as opposed to just having everything made easier for them. In this situation, everyone eventually benefits. Local consumers face lower retail costs, the businesses become more competitive which allows them to compete in the international market, and the knock-on effects of increased industry means that the government also benefits from macroeconomic improvements.",

    "body": "Thank you madam prime minister for your unequivocal rejection of Hefazat-e-Islam’s demand for retrograde blasphemy laws. It comes as an enormous relief for every free-thinking individual in Bangladesh and sets a perfect tone for our nation’s reckoning with the Islamist agenda. Hefazat-e-Islam’s demands didn’t come as a complete surprise to us. For a number of years ultra-conservative Islamic forces, almost entirely linked to a global “Islamic awakening,” have been trying to roll back the strides made by Bangladeshi society towards a secular, inclusive and free country, where muzzling opinions is something we simply don’t endorse. Just as all those values came under intense attack and an existentialist threat loomed large, the government, which looked like it was wavering slightly, has come back strong and certain. There will be no blasphemy laws in Bangladesh. “Existing laws are enough,” said the prime minister, “this country is a secular democracy.” Truth is, blasphemy laws have no scriptural currency. There are no clear mentions of them in the Quran or the Hadith and result from judicial rulings that became Sharia law. But even if there were, we are, as the prime minister says, a secular country and our government is not in the business of moral policing. The law that does exist about offending religious sentiments (Section 295[A] of the Penal Code) falls squarely within the realm of maintaining public order and is exactly the extent of any secular government’s writ into issues of sentiment and faith. Anything beyond that is an intrusion into personal territory. But Hefazat-e-Islam has gone deep into this territory with their flippant use of labels like “atheist”, “anti-Islamic”, “immoral” and many others that seem to assume we, as a nation, have to measure up to their standards of what is acceptable. We most certainly do not.",

    "title": "Keep them in jail",
    "body": "The recent move by the government to arrest leaders of the opposition should be seen as a step in the right direction with regard to restoring law and order in the nation. While the move is obviously politically motivated, it sends out a very important message – the leaders of the respective political groups are ultimately responsible for any illegal activities carried out in their name during periods of unrest i.e. hartals. This move should give pause to those members involved in the political process to think twice about actually “enforcing” what is supposed to be a voluntary nationwide shutdown. The message from the leadership of the opposition to their activists on the ground should be crystal clear; any illegal activities they may be involved with will have direct repercussions at various levels of their party hierarchy. The irony of the situation lies in the fact that, in retaliation to this government initiative, the opposition party is doing exactly what put them in this unfortunate situation to begin with. It seems high time for them to recognise the futility of this form of protest. Additionally, this same rule needs to be applicable across the board. Those in power must be entirely objective when it comes to doling out such punishments. They must ensure that the same repercussions exist, and are enforced, for their own leadership, if the situation warrants such action. There cannot be a double standard. In the meantime, the government should use this action as a bargaining chip in pushing forth real reform to the nation’s political processes. They can use this leverage to compel the opposition into a more participatory style of politics based on dialogue and compromise. The ball is now in the government’s court to see what creative and positive outcomes they can wrangle out of the situation.",

    "body": "While it is certainly right to applaud comments made by our prime minister with regards to nixing the idea of incorporating blasphemy laws into our countries legal system, we should also be aware of less palatable comments made in the same interview regarding the formation of a caretaker government. Hasina made very clear that she would not be re-instituting the caretaker system in the run-up to the polls. While we understand her position, it is very hard to agree with. We do not question the legality of scrapping the constitutional requirement of having a caretaker government run the elections; the prime minister had the votes required to get the amendment passed. Instead, we question the wisdom of this move from a political point of view. Public opinion seems to be against her in this, regardless of whether or not fair elections can be held without the caretaker government in place. As the public is clearly against the move, it should have been based on a public referendum as opposed to a vote in parliament. Our lawmakers, including our prime minister, do not seem attuned to the concerns of the public. They can remedy the situation by using this as an opportunity, not just to gain popular favour, but to also bring the opposition back into the fold. By re-instituting, or at least talking about re-instituting the caretaker government system, Hasina could, without a doubt, raise the profile of her political party in the public’s eyes. Additionally, this could provide the leverage she needs to stop the spate of hartals that has been plaguing the nation. It would be an all-out political triumph. What remains to be seen is if such a course of action will even cross the minds of those in power.",

The Chinese bank ICBC ousted Exxon Mobil as the world's biggest company, according to the magazine's 10th annual ranking of the world's top 2,000 firms. China Construction Bank bumped JP Morgan out of the second spot. The US had a total of 543 members in the list this year, 19 more firms than last year and the highest total since 2009. Japan had the second highest number of companies in the list, 251, followed by China with 136. For the first time since 2004, when the list was first published, China did not increase its number of Global 2000 companies. The list uses an equal weighting of sales, profits, assets and market value to rank companies according to size. Exxon, last year's No 1, slipped into fourth place this year behind the two Chinese firms, JP Morgan and General Electric. Apple eclipsed Exxon as the most valuable company by market capitalization last year and the two have vied for pole position ever since. Apple slipped behind Exxon once more on Wednesday. Despite a 24% drop in the Apple share price since last March, Forbes's composite ranking placed Apple at No 15, in a tie with WalMart, the world's largest retailer. Banks and other financial-services firms dominate the list, accounting for 469 of the world's top companies, down nine from last year. The next three biggest industries by membership are oil and gas (124), materials (122) and insurance (109).",

    "body": "A target has been fixed to produce some 18,468 tonnes of maize from 2,565 hectares of land in nine upazilas of Kurigram in the current summer, UNB reported today. It is expected production in the char (landmass emerged from riverbeds) areas of Roumari and Rajibpurupazilas would be higher than Nageswari and Bhurugamariupazilas. Farmers this year are using high breed seeds like Pioneer 30V 92, Elit, Uttaran, NK-40, Pacific, CP-802 etc. Sources at the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) said maize is usually cultivated in the winter season. Maize production target in the district has been increased this year upon getting its expected yield from the silted soil of the area and to gradually reduce the gap with its demand. Besides, farmers in the char areas can cultivate maize through an artificial irrigation system. In the current season, the DAE expects production of 250 tonnes of maize in Kurigram Sadar, 125 tonnes of maize in Ulipur, 350 tonnes in Chilmari, 985 tonnes in Roumari, 500 tonnes in Rajibpur, 30 tonnes in Bhurungamari, 25 tonnes in Nageswari, 100 tonees in Phulbari and 200 tonnes in Rajarhatupazila. Farmer Anil Chandra Sarkar of KhalishaKalua village under Kanthalbari union of KurigramSadar said he sawed highbred seed NK-40 on 20 decimals of land spending Tk3,500. He expects to harvest 20 maunds of maize from the field. He hopes to earn Tk16,000 from sale of the crop at Tk8,00 per maund. Local farmers said it cost Tk10,000 to Tk11,000 to cultivate maize on one bigha of land. If there is good production, one can get two to three times the profit. As a result, farmers are getting more interested in cultivating maize than boro paddy. Kurigram DAE deputy director Pratip Kumar Mondol said farmers are opting for maize farming due to favourable climate and easy availability of the inputs.",

    "title": "The age of the citizen: Who really speaks for the people?",
    "body": "The nature of politics has changed throughout the world. In the past, the masses would beg for leaders. Nowadays, however, from the “99%” in downtown New York to Tahrir and Shahbag, the citizen is the leader. The issues that these citizens are imposing on the political class may be unrealistic (Occupy Wall Street sought the end of the capitalist system), but it is the voice of the people that has risen to set the agenda. This voice can no longer be ignored. The Arab Spring was indeed a paradigm shift in the history of the Middle East and beyond, as it offered an old-new idea with a twist. “Al-Shaab Yurid” (the people want …) has been the slogan of every revolution in history, claiming to be the will of the people. Today, there is a new twist to this will – the people themselves are making the demand, not someone who speaks on behalf of them. The people did not ask for, nor did they need, a leader. These are mass movements without leadership, the kind that history has not known. The real revolution is that we now have leaderless revolutions. Yet, this does not imply that the political class has become obsolete. On the contrary, it simply has to accept its new role, which is to respond to, and engage the demands of the citizen. It no longer speaks for the citizen, but speaks to the citizen.Only those political figures who are able to grasp this lesson will survive. Those who do not understand will not. This dramatic change is driven by new realities. We have indeed become one global village. Our eyes and ears are attuned to wherever our fellow humans are suffering. Bashar al-Assad’s father crushed a rebellion in 1982 in a few quick months of un-witnessed slaughter. Bashar himself, while having exceeded his father’s brutality already, has been under the watchful eyes of citizens across the globe.Yet, the leaders have clearly failed to act in a decisive manner. Syria’s citizens will get their freedom and international leaders who have been in dereliction of their duty will pay a price. These lessons are for the entire world to contemplate. It is the age of the citizen.Fictional democracy will no longer be sufficient. Not in New York, not in Cairo, and certainly not in Dhaka. Asma Mahfouz, the young Egyptian activist whose YouTube post stunned and embarrassed her countrymen into joining her at Tahrir Square, received a European prize for human rights in 2012. This young woman stood in front of hundreds of veteran human rights activists all over the western world and, in a respectful and calm voice, told them: “You have nothing to teach us; we will chart our own way.” Asma Mahfouz was not speaking on behalf of Egypt.Instead, she spoke on behalf of her generation and in the realisation that it is the citizen who can demand justice, and it is this same citizen who will go ahead and enforce justice. States are not irrelevant but they can no longer be an apparatus of control, as in the past. States ought to be the citizen’s framework for protection: for the citizens, not against the citizens. With the events of the past few years, we have truly entered the 21st century. We now know that politics in this century are dramatically different from those of the last.We should also know that to move forward in this century we ought to be looking forward.Although our past defines us, we will not be hostage to it. Again, this is true in New York, true in Cairo and true in Dhaka.",

When you make lists of enemies, threaten family connections, wage individualised wars against bloggers, don’t be surprised when the state decides to do the same – only this time, against your own people. When you burn newspapers because of a story, you lose the ground to oppose a future where Islamists (or someone else) may have the right to burn your newspapers. Actually, they already did– remember that cat cartoon from a few years back? Now, next time something like that happens, our movements against such “offensensitivity” will have to come with a “but.” You forgot, for the sake of Shahbag, that only two months ago, this same government was authorising the use of pepper spray on a Communist party strike, and on a teachers’ rally at Shaheed Minar. You forgot that this same government allowed new encroachment by some unscrupulous companies. You blanked out that this same apparatus engineered a forced-ouster of Dr. Yunus, from the Grameen Bank. This same managerial incompetence produced endless financial scandals – Padma Bridge, Hallmark, the current stock market calamity. You especially forgot that this same government rode roughshod over the courts for four years. They are now making a fiasco of these war crimes trials, chipping away at the legitimacy of a worthy project – justice for 1971. You forgave all that because, just this once, they were doing something you wanted. As a political orphan, you are hungry for any sign of affection. “Ektu mathaye haat buliye din (just rub my head a little), please.” What if the demands to ban a party, their blogs, their newspapers, result in the state using those same powers to ban your party (small as it may be), your blogs, or your newspapers? One last thought. Remember those CCTV cameras that the government installed for “our protection”? A kind and generous state, making sure our Shahbag nights are peaceful. Now that the crush of crowds has shrunk, those CCTV cameras are unnecessary, right? They will stay on, watching each and every breath we take. Shahbag’s repercussion, so far, has not been a more robust war crimes process, nor a weakened Jamaat-e-Islami. Instead, we have been gifted a heavily fortified, ruthless panopticon.

However, turnover crossed Tk2 bn-mark, mostly riding on quarterly expectation-driven movements. Of the 275 issues traded at the DSE, 155 advanced, 97 declined and 23 remained unchanged. Except for mutual funds all other sectors closed flat. Mutual funds gained 2.74%, continuing positive ride for last couple of days. Its turnover almost doubled from Tk102m to Tk207m. Banks once again showed minor correction stretching its bearish sidewalk. Travel and leisure sector lost most as it conceded 1.37% loss as Unique Hotel and Resorts lost 1.74%. Textiles sector occupied the top turnover position with shares worth Tk334.5m. Most of the scrips from textiles side were flat but a couple of them performed well. IT sector managed to gain 1.92%. A couple of shares gained more than 4%. Although heavyweight Titas Gas gained 3%, oil scrips suffered pretty badly. Titas Gas was the most traded stocks on the day with shares worth Tk107m changing hands. Orion Pharma, Bengal Windsor Thermoplastic, Summit Purbanchol Power and Aamra Technologies were the day’s next popular stocks. The other major sectors posted marginal gains with telecommunications and pharmaceuticals going up by 0.29%and 0.01%respectively. Newly listed Bengal Windsor Thermoplastic was the day’s highest gainer, posting a rise of 10%on its third day of trade followed by Chittagong Vegetable and Jute Spinners which also hit the upper limit of the circuit breaker. City General Insurance was the day’s worst loser, slumping by 8.46% following its corporate declaration of 10% stock dividend.",

    "body": "Hartals are bad for business. We have heard this line over and over as the spate of hartals in the country has continued unabated. This year, we have even had numerical proof offered to us that suggests the country loses Tk160m for every day that a hartal is called and enforced. What are these people talking about? Their research has clearly not gone deep enough. There are some factors that the researchers definitely overlooked. Look at all of these entrepreneurs who have recently gotten into the bomb-making industry. Yes, you did read that correctly. Apparently making bombs isn’t quite as sophisticated as most people think. Especially not the kind of handmade bombs that are used to wreak havoc during hartal days. Staying true to their entrepreneurial spirit, the people of Bangladesh have risen to the task of meeting the explosive-related demands of hartal enforcers by going into full production mode. The number of mom-and-pop type bomb shops has mushroomed. After all, in the kind of free market economy Bangladesh seeks to achieve, the demands of the consumer must be met. Given the information we have about these bombs, the demand apparently specifies that the bomb must be able to physically harm and maim innocent bystanders in addition to scaring them. But all joking aside, the kind of mentality that currently pervades the political mind-set in the country is baffling. Although we hear a lot of grandiose rhetoricfrom our leaders about democracy, in actuality it would appear that they misunderstand how to practice this form of governance. A democratic country should have no place for either the fear tactics that are a staple of hartal days or the activities of businessmen without a conscience, who seek to take advantage of others’ penchant for violence.",

While it is no secret that Bangladesh is not known for having a great railway system, the accident is a stark reminder that the problem can no longer be ignored. Not only do such accidents result in a tragic loss of life, their effects are also felt in the economy, and in the road networks that surround the accident sites. The fact that freight trains move through a densely populated and poorly planned city is ludicrous to begin with. The rail link that passes through Dhaka is not necessary; there could easily be separate stations in the north and south of the city that provide connections to the rest of the country accordingly, linked by a line that bypasses the city itself. This would do away with the need to have a national railway line running through the capital. Within the Dhaka city limits, the only trains that should run are intra-city trains, or, even better, sky trains, or underground trains, for the best use of available space. Essentially, the kind of commuter trains that would ease the awful congestion Dhaka faces every day. The railway administration is quick to make complaints about a lack of both skilled personnel and actual trains, but what they seem to forget is that it is their responsibility to develop and implement initiatives that address these issues. The government, as a whole, needs to do its part in supporting positive initiatives put forth by railway authorities and ensure that the resources necessary to keep this vital system running are available as and when required. It falls to the public to hold them accountable. It shouldn’t take much to avoid these kinds of careless accidents. We, as a people, and the government that represents us, have just become apathetic to these issues. Until these accidents occur and show us the folly of our apathy.",

This is outrageous. Indeed, it is far beyond comprehension that an employer would rather take up a gun and seek to maim, if not kill, his or her workers, than pay them their dues. This can’t go on. We must protect our migrant workers as they are the backbone of our nation and economy. We owe them at least that much, if not far more. These workers toil away in virtual slave labour conditions for dreadful wages, and often, as this situation blatantly reveals, they receive horrific treatment at the hands of their employers. It is nowhere near enough for the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment to merely provide Bangladeshi migrant workers with employment opportunities, and then leave them to the wolves, to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers and abused. A policy must be implemented to protect them and ensure that the employers who hire them are trustworthy, would grant them fair wages and good working conditions, and are called to account if they do not. This latest incident is a shockwave that should jar the ministry into immediate action; in this case, the implementation of such a policy should be its first priority. Our migrant workers must be kept safe and be taken care of so as to prevent disgraceful incidents such as this shooting from occurring again. Their survival as well as that of our nation is at stake.",

    "title": "G20 urges global community to end banking secrecy",
    "body": "The Group of 20 economic powers yesterday urged the global adoption of standards for sharing bank account information in an effort to fight tax evasion and curtail banking secrecy. The G20 said they “strongly encourage” all countries to sign on to a commitment to the automatic exchange of banking information “which is expected to be the standard,” in the group’s strongest endorsement yet of a move that takes aim especially at tax havens. “More needs to be done to address the issues of international tax avoidance and evasion, in particular through tax havens, as well as non-cooperative jurisdictions,” the G20 said in a statement on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. The group urged all countries to accept the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, a framework for the sharing of banking data. “We welcome progress made towards automatic exchange of information which is expected to be the standard and urge all jurisdictions to move towards exchanging information automatically with their treaty partners, as appropriate.” The move aims ultimately to have banks automatically supply information to a country on the accounts of its nationals, in the way the US FATCA -- the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act -- requires information on Americans’ accounts abroad. “A door toward the end of banking secrecy is open. It is something extremely important,” French finance minister Pierre Moscovici said late Thursday. There is “an unstoppable movement toward a ‘European FATCA’” he said, but that and the US effort need to be elevated to the level of the G20. Ollie Rehn, vice president of the European Commission, hailed the G20’s offensive against banking secrecy. “We particularly welcome today’s endorsement of automatic exchange of information, and look forward to working with the OECD and G20 countries on developing new international standards on this,” Rehn told journalists. A senior US Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the G20 statement was a strong endorsement, and that more and more countries understood the importance of fighting tax evasion. Pushing the issue on the institutional level is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), whose Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is helping set standards and advance commitment to the effort. The European crisis has heightened the issue of tax evasion in the eurozone, and more countries have shown interest. The new approach threatens importantly Switzerland’s longstanding role as a leader in providing secrecy in banking to those who want it -- a pitch that underpins its huge banking industry. Switzerland is one of 14 countries which have not yet signed on to the basic ideas of bank information sharing, under the OECD Global Forum guidelines.",

    "title": "Tea faces a torrid time",
    "body": "Country’s tea export may face a severe setback after three years if necessary steps are not immediately taken for increasing its production. “Our tea has a great demand in internal as well as external markets. The demand is on the rise day by day, but production of tea in the country has not increased in proportion to the requirement,” Joint secretary (export) of Commerce Ministry Atiqur Rahman told UNB. “If the trend continues, the country may not be able to export tea. Rather, we’ll have to import tea to meet our internal demand after three years,” he said. Last year, some 64m kg of tea was produced in the country, while the internal demand was 63m kg. The country earned foreign exchange worth Tk222.3m by exporting 1.5m kg of tea last year, according to official sources. However, unofficial sources said that the internal demand is more than the official figure. According to the Commerce Ministry, internal tea consumption is rising every year 12.69% due to the rise of population and urbanisation. Tea export is decreasing annually by 8.77% due to the increasing internal consumption. If this trend continues, there will be no tea left for export after 2016. Rather, the country will have to import tea from abroad to meet the internal demand, said the sources. In the past, tea played a significant role in the country’s economic development by earning foreign exchange. But, its export earning has been witnessing fall over the last five years. According to official sources, Bangladesh earned Tk899m by exporting 10.56m kg of tea in 2007; Tk9770m by exporting 8.39m kg tea in 2008; Tk 433.5m by exporting 3.15m kg in 2009; Tk176.7m by exporting 0.91m kg in 2010; Tk231.2m by exporting 1.47m kg in 2011; and Tk222.3m by exporting 1.50m kg in 2012. The country has a total of 165 tea gardens where 116,011 hectare of land is brought under tea cultivation. But, a portion of land in the tea gardens remained unutilised. In the last 10 years (2003-12), some 83.40% of tea produced in the country was used for internal consumption, while 11.07% exported abroad. At present, Bangladesh exports tea to countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Ukraine and UK after meeting the internal demand. Expressing concern over the inadequate tea production, Bangladesh Tea Association President Safwan Chowdhury said the government should give more attention to the tea sector for increasing its output. “We urged the government to give more soft loans for increasing the tea output. At present, tea growers are given loan at 9% interest rate. We call for further reduction of interest rate,” he said. Assistant secretary of the Commerce Ministry Khurshid Alam Siddique said Bangladesh Tea Board has taken up 10 projects of 12-year duration to produce 100m kg of tea annually by 2021. The projects include bringing about 6,440 hectare of fallow land in six districts -- Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet, Chittagong, Rangamati and Panchagarh -- under tea farming by June 2019 in order to increase the tea production. Some 19,000 people will also get employment under the projects that will cost about Tk2050m. A proposal seeking the amount has already been sent to the Finance Ministry. Referring to the lease of government khas land for tea cultivation, AKM Shamsul Arefin, deputy secretary (khas land-1) of the Land Ministry, told UNB that there is dearth of suitable khas land for tea farming. He, however, said huge area of government khas land in Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet and CHT region are now illegally occupied by different quarters. Those lands can be used for tea cultivation.",

    "title": "Time for us to define Bangladesh",
    "body": "‘Amar Shonar Bangladesh” - iconic words from the first days of our independence. Bangabandhu spoke these words from his heart. In those three simple words, I believe, he expressed a vision of what he thought Bangladesh could become: A country that could fulfil its potential through the expression of a historic culture. The vigorous uprisings across Bangladesh these last few months, (Shahbag, Jamaat, Hefazat, and even the Banani lungi march) got me thinking: Is there a clear vision of what “Amar Shonar Bangladesh” might look like? How do we make Bangladesh into a country of opportunities? Most importantly, just where do we start and in what direction should the country aim? When I speak with Bangladeshis or foreigners about Bangladesh and ask them to describe it, those with an opinion use words such as disaster zone, corrupt, untrustworthy, bureaucratic, uneducated, illiterate, backward and poverty stricken. If we are honest, there is some truth to this perception. But surely that can’t be the “Shonar Bangladesh” that millions of patriotic freedom fighters died for? When you travel the country and experience everyday life, as it exists for the majority of people in Bangladesh (outside metro Dhaka), another equally true and more magical and beautiful reality exists. Bangladeshis are possibly the most patriotic people on the planet, first demonstrated before 1971 by those Bangladeshis who were inspired by the love of their language in the war for independence. According to a recent global study, Bangladeshis are amongst the happiest people in the world. When Bangladeshis go abroad they are incredibly entrepreneurial, best evidenced by the business-savvy Sylhetis who dominate the lucrative curry restaurant industry in the UK, due in part to their incredible hospitality. There are thousands of examples of world-class professionals from Bangladesh or of Bangladeshi origin who have reached the pinnacle of their respective professions, exemplified by the achievements of Irene Khan, the former Secretary General of Amnesty International, for instance. Additionally, no one comments on how Bangladeshis regularly overcome natural calamities because of their amazing resilience. Bangladeshis have also shown how hardworking they can be through the advances of the ready-to-wear garments industry, as well as their innate creativity, evidenced by the beautiful saris and handicrafts sold in shops across the country. Likewise, through the brilliance of Noble Laureate Professor Yunus, Bangladesh created the microcredit banking business model that, despite some flaws, continues to help millions escape poverty. On top of this, Bangladesh itself possesses some unique natural beauty like its tea estates in Sylhet, the world’s longest uninterrupted beach at Cox’s bazaar, the tropical beauty of the Sundarbans and the rich tribal cultures that exist within the Chittagong Hill Tracts area. Lastly, Bangladesh boasts one of the world’s most diverse and sophisticated cuisines, absorbing all of North India’s culinary virtues into our own unique staple cuisine which makes use of over 4000 types of fish, such as hilsa, and our vast array of tropical vegetables, many of which are only grown within the country (for example, Sylhet’s shatkura). There is no doubt that Bangladesh possesses a split personality and has two sides to her national identity. Despite this, for some reason, it seems that it is the negative aspect that people choose to see. I would contend that it is the second set of values that genuinely articulate the unique features of the Bangladeshi people. Hence, imagine a Bangladesh that is famous only for these values. Imagine if people around the world thought of these things when they thought of our country. Imagine, close your eyes and imagine – it is without a doubt one of the most amazing and wonderful countries in the world. If we could create a country that reflected these values and behaviours, and most critically deliver upon them each and every time, there would be many dramatic benefits to our economy and way of life. Not only would it inspire a hugely profitable tourism industry, it would also allow many Bangladeshi exports to command a greater premium on the international market. “Made in Bangladesh” today contains many of the negative stereotypes that I mentioned earlier. But if we could dispose of the negative side of the Bangladeshi coin, then “Made in Bangladesh” suddenly becomes much more desirable. My frustration lies in that none of these values fall into the realm of fantasy, nor do they require cultivation: tens of millions of Bangladeshis exhibit these traits each and every day. I was at Doha airport recently and saw the Bangladesh under-13 football team who had participated in an Asian football tournament and were waiting for their flight back to Dhaka. They were the best-behaved people in the entire airport, had joyful smiles on their faces and were a beautiful representation of their nation. Everybody has a role to play just like these young boys. Every single foreigner I have brought to Bangladesh arrives with negative assumptions and leaves with wonderfully positive memories. But for perceptions to change, we first have to change ourselves. Each of us has to consistently behave in a way that reflects the true nature of the country as I believe it to be, to only talk about the wonderful positive stories that happen every day, to celebrate what is good in society and culture. Only then will perceptions change. If that can happen, I’m convinced that Bangladesh can, in an extremely short period of time, unleash its enormous potential and change its destiny, maybe even within a generation!

    "title": "Come flap your lungis! All garments deserve equality!",
    "body": "Little did I imagine, when I wrote the poem, that a dramatic opportunity to translate words into action would suddenly present itself, and that too amidst a continuing, nerve-wracking political crisis that has violently split the country into two definitive camps. The Baridhara Society’s decision to bar lungi-clad “rickshawallas” from their locality could be just as divisive, though mercifully devoid of violence. At the very least, it too roused city youths to use social media to organise a lungi parade, if not a lungi “mancha.” It turned into a cheerful lungi sit-in and lungi fashion parade, but participants gracefully refused to engage the armed minions of the state. I would have been there – if it weren’t for the sudden irruption of a tummy bug. In three days I lost five kilograms and in the process gained a renewed respect for the lungi. Had it not been for this versatile garment, I would not only have lost a dozen pounds but also would have soiled a dozen pajamas. Of course I took part in the lungi parade, in spirit, while doing some Google-powered, lungi-related research. I discovered that the Baridhara Society is not alone among public bodies in its antipathy to the public use of the lungi. Sharjah has long banned it from certain establishments – lungi-clad South Asians, caught unawares, have been hauled off by police. Some have pointed out the illogicality of it all: when it comes to sartorial “decency,” how is a lungi and kurta inferior to the local robe, called a “taub,” I believe? Analysed logically, the Sharjah ban amounts to favouring “one-piece” and decrying “two-piece” - it is clearly unfair and the sort of thing that has been definitively satirised by Jonathan Swift in Gulliver’s Travels. But if we graduate from cold logic to hot cultural studies, it becomes clear that prejudice is at play. We are the big bosses, we wear this, therefore it is refined, decent, civilised; you are servants, you wear that, therefore it is vulgar, uncivilised, and must not be seen. Needless to point out, it isn’t a question of a two-legged garment over a skirt-like one either. A kilt is fine. When we come to the kind of prejudice we are talking about, it can cut both ways. The ancient Greeks found trousers worn by Persians funny; Romans thought trousers smacked of barbarism. What ought to happen is obvious: the lungi should be universally granted equality with all other garments, as it has been in at least two countries: Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Perhaps the leaders of these countries could act as the vanguard in an international campaign. Imagine what would happen if lungi-clad delegations from these countries arrived at Sharjah. Would the soldiers lined up to present a guard of honour point their guns at the VVIPs, and march them off to prison? The thought of it! Perhaps we should also campaign to have an International Lungi Day observed worldwide. Just as, through the International Mother Language Day, the struggle in favour of Bangla has come to symbolise the struggle for survival of threatened languages, an International Lungi Day would come to symbolise the struggle of all forms of attire to be treated with dignity. Let thousands of ways of covering our bottoms flourish. Vive la difference! l Kaiser Haq is a poet, critic and professor of English at the University of Dhaka.",

    "title": "The Hefazat long march signaled a new normal",
    "body": "If recent events were billed as a show of strength between Islamist and secular forces in Bangladesh, the showdown fizzled. The Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam, led by the aging cleric Ahmad Shafi, was able to draw hundreds of thousands of supporters to Motijheel during their long march program, dwarfing the counter-rallies organised on that day by opponents. The general strike and blockade called by the latter failed to stem the flow of white-robed men marching on Motijheel. On the one hand, the relatively peaceful end to the Hefazat “long march” drew a sigh of relief from jittery Dhakaites. But, on the other, the success of the march, and the strength of the following programmes, clearly signalled a realignment of political forces in Bangladesh – one that seemed impossible just a short while ago, with Shahbagh at its peak. The sight of prominent leaders of the BNP and the Jatiya Party – an ally of AL – at the Hefazat rally was testimony to the new polarisation that appears to have taken place in the country. The Shahbagh rallies of February-March, led by mostly left-leaning secular, middle class youth, painted a picture of a Bangladesh divided between supporters of the Jamaat, in the dock for 1971 war crimes and those against Jamaat. But almost unnoticed, the lines have been redrawn. The Hefazat grand rally clearly indicates a secular-Islamist polarisation and even hints at an urban-rural divide reminiscent of the aftermath of the Tahrir Square uprising in Egypt. Hefazat-e-Islam, led by clerics from the Qaumi Madrassas, is no ally of the Jamaat. Their ideological enmity dates back almost a century to the time Hussein Ahmad Madani, Ahmad Shafi’s teacher, denounced Abul A’la Maududi, the spiritual founder of Jamaat-e-Islami. The fact that Hefazat has joined the fray is a reflection of the concern felt by many conservative Muslims that the Islamic culture and way of life is under attack. It is just what the government didn’t want. Desperate to avoid a confrontation with the clerics, who still wield influence in the countryside, the government arrested several “atheist” bloggers. The moves failed to appease Hefazat leaders who dismissed them. The organisers of the Shahbagh Mancha positioned themselves squarely against the Hefazat, and Islamist parties as a whole, by calling for a blockade to stop the Qaumi supporters from entering the city, and speaking out against them in the time since. The tactics did not succeed and may have hurt the Shahbagh youths’ free speech credentials, an action they have yet to remedy. It also reinforced the impression that the political debate is no longer “pro-liberation” and “anti-liberation” but secularist versus Islamist. Hefazat’s demands may conflict with liberal values, but in the villages, such views are common. With elections around the corner, it may become increasingly difficult for political parties to ignore such sentiments. Syed Zain Al-Mahmood is online and digital editor, Dhaka Tribune",

    "title": "Blaming the government? Time to put things into context",
    "body": "Those who speak in the public domain tend to blame the government for whatever happens around us. People often contradict themselves when they place blame on the government’s shoulders. For example, many people blamed the government for granting permission to Hefazat-e-Islam to go through with their grand congregation, while others criticised the government for creating impediments in Hefazat’s procession and gathering. While the government does shoulder some blame, we need to account for the pressure they face, and our own points of view. In a democracy, elected political parties assume the power. The ideologies, values and policies of the parties are reflected in their activities, but they have to remain objective in their governance. Recently, Hefazat-e-Islam added another perspective to the political landscape. The secular segment of civil society was in favor of impeding the gathering and blamed the government for permitting Hefazat to gather, while the other, Islamist segment who called for this congregation also had their own complaints. The Awami League-led government was put in a position where it had to strike a balance between the two opposing factions. The government was right to give permission to Hefazat to go forth with their plans. As long as Hefazat sought permission within the current legal framework, the government was obliged to allow them to gather. The government was able to carry out their obligation to one faction and the result was that the public became aware of Hefazat’s point of view, as inferred from their 13-point charter. The government also made the right decision in complying with Hefazat’s primary demand, which was to take legal action against those who offended religious sentiments. If the government had ignored Hefazat, they may have pushed the group towards Jamaat, which would have made the war crime trials more difficult to implement. Separating religion from politics in Bangladesh will take some time, because these “anti-liberation” forces were allowed to reintegrated after 1975 and able to set down their roots. This was the only feasible solution at the time. It is important for us to be patient and gradually tackle our problems. A false step now may put us in greater danger. We want to see our country embrace the spirit of 1971, secular and modern, but our present situation demands caution in achieving our final goal.

My bigger problem, however, was with the recipient itself. Facebook has, more than any other factor, been responsible for eroding efficiency at the workplace. With the endless flow of apps and layout changes, it is practically impossible to maintain one’s full human resource capacity while being a functioning Facebook user. I suppose I could go medieval and firewall Facebook in my office, and, to be fair, I actually did contemplate such extreme measures. But then Shahbag, in all its glory, happened. Before Shahbag, banning Facebook at work would simply be viewed as an anachronistic human resource practice perpetrated by out of touch managers. Employees would whine and moan about their feudalistic bosses, but would be secretly pleased by the extra time they needed to get their work done, while alerting the world about their “plight” through Facebook on their mobiles. It would be an irksome but manageable standoff between the management and the minions. Since Shahbag, however, Facebook has become a different beast altogether. Banning Facebook has not only become unfashionable, it has become downright “Hitlerist.” A gross violation of the democratic right to free speech, protest, and changing of the world that young people seem to have become disturbingly addicted to. Their sense of agency is scary, and most managers, including myself, would not touch Facebook with a ten-foot pole. It has become the third rail of human resource best practice. You touch it, you die. Let me illustrate this with two conversations between a Facebooking intern and myself, one pre- Shahbag, one post. Pre-Shahbag Me: Hey son, what are you doing? Intern: Online research sir! Me: No you are not! (Slap on the back of the head) You are Facebooking!!! Get to work weasel!!!! Post-Shahbag Me: Hey comrade, what are you up to? Intern: Writing a status on Facebook, buddy. Me: No kidding! But aren’t you supposed to give me that PPT in half an hour? Intern: AND FAIL MY COUNTRY??? MY PEERS???? What are you, sir??? A Razakar???? Have you no shame??? Me: As you were, boss. As you were. The dynamic has clearly shifted dangerously. From the exploiter I have become the exploited, or at least a 200-pound rodent furtively moving around the office, and desperately trying not to step on any Facebookers’ toes. I am backed into a corner, as are, surely, many of my fellow slave drivers. Thus I have no choice but to formulate my own x-point demand about Facebook. It is a matter of my survival. My x-point demands are as follows: Ban Facebook from the country, so that we don’t have to ban Facebook from the workplace; Put an immediate end to all business unfriendly practices such as salaries, overtime compensation, health insurance, lunch, and conveyance; Make it mandatory for employees to do a three second Bharat Nattyam move followed by genuflection every time they see their bosses; Transfer all tax burdens from hardworking bosses to atheistic, blogging, bleeding heart Facebook employees. Having learnt my lesson from recent demands made by others, I am keeping my own list short and manageable. Nothing discredits a movement more than overreaching on the part of its conveners. But rest assured, if my demands are not met, I will do something drastic. Like write on my Facebook wall. I may even tag others in my status. That is when the fun will start. But seriously, faux fascism aside, who would have thought? Facebook, an idiots’ playground, where I whiled away so many useless hours planting vegetables, has turned into such a genuine platform for civil protest. On my recent trip abroad, I was getting more updates about the events at home through Facebook than I was through our news outlets. Hundreds and thousands of Facebook users who had previously listed their political preference as “None” or “I hate politics” now rarely read or write about anything other than politics. Sure, everything that is written may not be savoury or smart, but the energy is palpable and largely positive. Even if the Facebook vigour seems esoteric in the larger context, it has in the very least produced a significant group of educated youth who are conversing about the nation’s future, instead of discussing Ranbir Kapoor’s latest hairstyle. And if recent historical events are any evidence, this engagement will turn into physical action against the wrongs of society. That cannot be anything but positive for our future. So a big “Like” to Mr Zuckerberg and his gleeful army. And glassdoor is forgiven. The employer’s hat is not easy to doff, however, and I am steadfast in my threat to write a status if my demands are not met, or if glassdoor.com does not give me some kind of recognition next year.

You can have your opinions about the movement, be dismissive or inspired, but one thing few can argue is that online activists played a critical role in using the Internet to organise and spread the story, and got thousands of young Bangladeshis to work together. The role technology is playing in current events in Bangladesh is revolutionary. It was Bangladeshi online activists and bloggers who first protested Kader Mollah’s verdict, demanding the death sentence, used social media to spread the word, and staged sit-ins. That set off the series of events which have brought us to the present day. The recent crackdown on bloggers confirms the power online activism enjoys. The participation of women in this movement is also unique. Many attribute this to the fact that women in Bangladesh have been organising at the grassroots level for decades. Seeing female leadership in Bangladesh is not really something new to us, despite our patriarchal cultural roots. We have managed to have women in major leadership roles across the board. The Arab Spring may have showed the world how to use social media to build one’s political platform, but this generation of Bangladeshis showed the nation, and the world, how to use the Internet to try to finally gain closure from a bloody Liberation War from which the nation is still struggling to fully recover. The view from abroad as a Bangladeshi was electrifying. Almost immediately my Facebook and Twitter feeds became consumed with the word “Shahbag.” It did not take long to figure out what my fellow Bangladeshis were talking about, or reach across the oceans and find one another. As the “Western media” grappled with why thousands of youth were pouring into Dhaka’s streets, and holding images of the hang-man’s noose, Bangladeshis from Dhaka to Dallas were tweeting one another, connecting online, and reaching out to Bangladeshi writers around the world to ensure accurate coverage of Shahbag in the mainstream media. In the first few weeks of the Shahbag story, my posts were a direct result of the information I received from my social media contacts. Those who reached out to me did so to get the word out on a story that was largely being overlooked and misinterpreted. People I had never met were emailing me links, articles, and pictures to tell the world that the youth in Bangladesh would not sit idly by, while politicians paved their future without their participation. Bangladeshis, in Dhaka and across the world, were creating uproar on the streets of Dhaka and in the pathways of the Internet. The energy was palpable, and I felt an instant patriotic connection with my fellow Bangladeshis, a majority of whom were people I had never met. Although millions of people organise nearly millions of causes every day online, I had never experienced this camaraderie amongst my fellow countrymen. I grew up being told that my generation was passive and uninterested in the future of our country. As our parents recovered from 1971, we grappled with a Bangladesh in many ways at war with herself. What the Shahbag movement showed me, as a Bangladeshi not living in Bangladesh, is that my generation is informed, politically aware, protective of its history, and is online. It showed me that we are not apathetic about the future of Bangladesh. We may have fallen into a coma spanning four decades since 1971, but the youth of Bangladesh, across the world, are awake. Barriers that separate Bangladeshis across social customs, class and gender all seemingly disappear online. When “Internet trolls” harassed female writers online, myself included, fellow Bangladeshis I had never met came to my defence. Sometimes groups even organised online to stand up for us, and defend our work. So, while what is being done is nothing new, what is exciting is that Bangladeshi youth are doing it, too: Using the Internet to connect and communicate so as to cultivate a better path for the future of this country. This generation of Bangladeshis understand the power of online organising and is using it. Call me idealistic and naïve, but it is so electrifying and inspiring that it makes me believe and want to work for the kind of Bangladesh whose dream we keep nestled deep in our hearts. By positioning themselves at the forefront of these protests, Bangladeshi women and Bangladeshi youth are using their voices, and breaking an age-old myth that this generation is voiceless when it comes to our country’s politics and future. Shahbag changed all that. The voice of the new generation of Bangladeshis is informed, organised, aware, active and online. The question is: Are you listening?

    "title": "Shrimp exports get a boost as barriers removed",
    "body": "Exports of shrimp and frozen fish to the European Union (EU) market rose to Tk47.03bn last year, almost double the 2009 exports figure, as the government took stricter steps to maintain quality and control contamination. “The success we achieved has come due to the decision of the EU in November 2011 to withdraw the embargo of 20% compulsory test on frozen food items including shrimp and other fish items entering its market,” fisheries and livestock Minister Abdul Latif Bishwas told the Dhaka Tribune. The minister blamed unscrupulous exporters for creating trouble by exporting shrimp and fisheries items containing heavy metals and chemical contamination. He also said the EU authorities even closed its observation book for the Bangladeshi frozen food items as the officials concerned were satisfied with the measures the government recently took following complaints. “It has created a possibility for Bangladesh to be the lone Red-Alert-free country in Asia that are exporting frozen fisheries items to the EU. The export of fisheries items will increase further unless the exporters create any obstruction in this crucial export sector,” the minister declared. The compulsory tests for frozen food items is still effective for India, Thailand, Myanmar and the other countries in Asia who export fish products to the EU, said officials. According to the ministry data, Bangladesh exported shrimp and fisheries items to EU countries worth Tk47.03bn last year, up from only Tk20bn in 2009. Shrimp exports account for 80% of the total fishery exports to the EU. This sector has generated direct and indirect employment of some 12 million people and contributes over 4% of the GDP, industry insiders say. Exportable shrimps are cultivated mainly in Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Jessore, Narail, Cox’s Bazar, Pirojpur, and Gopalganj areas. Bangladesh mainly produces saline water bagda or black tiger shrimps and the rest are freshwater galda or green tiger prawns. The EU launched strict monitoring measures in 2009 after allegations were raised over the presence of harmful metallic elements and chemicals such as nitrofurans, a banned antibiotic, in the shrimps and fisheries items. “The EU delegates who were observing the frozen food items from Bangladesh are now satisfied over the measures we have taken after getting their complaints. Considering our precaution and measures, they submitted reports on our favour, and subsequently, the EU authorities gave us the clean chit,” the minister said. However the Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association (BFFEA) President Md Amin Ullah did not comment on the issue when approached by the Dhaka Tribune. Minister Bishwas said: “Bangladesh was about to lose its market in the world including the EU because of some dishonest traders. But the government tackled the situation carefully and solved the problems in the sector. They [the EU] were satisfied and withdraw the barriers.” The government has established modern quality control laboratories in Savar, Khulna, and Chittagong including LCMS (Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) and GCMS (Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) equipment. Installation of the laboratories in Chittagong and Khulna has been finished while construction of the Savar one is nearly complete, he added. According to the Department of Fisheries, the LCMS facility is applied mainly for the analysis of thermally unstable molecules in complex samples like biological fluids while the GCMS is applied for the analysis of volatile compounds in complex samples such as gasoline and petroleum products. The minister also added that an initiative titled “BEST Project” has been taken to improve the quality of shrimps in shrimp farming areas. “All the shrimp enclosures have been brought under registration and monitoring system to eliminate the risk of metallic and chemical contamination,” Bishwas said.",

    "title": "Get the wheels turning",
    "body": "The government’s inflexibility in its regulations with regard to the import of taxis is a glaring example of bureaucracy at its very worst. In a city crippled by traffic congestion, it makes no sense for the authorities to engage in actions that limit public transport options. A few days ago, the finance minister made the claim that traffic in the city could be curbed or controlled by limiting the import of private cars. While we do not necessarily agree with his assertion that limiting imports would be a good idea, having fewer private cars on the road certainly won’t hurt. However, the only way you can really stop people from taking their cars out is to provide viable alternatives – options that the city currently lacks. Options such as mass/bus rapid transit systems are impossible to implement in the short-term. This leaves us with improving the other options we currently enjoy. Unfortunately, the government itself, that should be solving these issues, is getting in the way instead. Taxis are a popular form of public transport the world over. In Dhaka, they have the potential to really improve the traffic situation. Their efficacy, in this regard, can be seen in other crowded Asian cities such as Jakarta and Bangkok. An addition to the current fleet of dilapidated taxis would definitely be welcome; many may be tempted to leave their cars at home. The personal benefits – not having to drive, park etc – are very real considerations for individuals. While regulations are required to ensure that certain standards are met. There is certainly a point where they become unnecessarily stifling. The authorities have not only let it get to that point, they are unbending in their stance, refusing to amend the regulations. The government should not worry itself with where the new fleet of taxis is painted, amongst other ridiculous examples. It is high time to take steps to remedy this issue.",

Ever since party political attrition spilled out onto the streets in the form of general strikes, violent clashes and repressive police action, our economic gains, along with their attendant social benefits, have begun to evaporate. Just four years ago, Bangladesh managed to beat out India and secure the second largest chunk of a multi-billion dollar industry that, incidentally, provides the lion’s share of our export earnings. Our cost-advantage is hard to match and international buyers were rushing to our factories providing our people, especially our women, with much-needed employment and the financial opportunity to flourish. Now the same buyers are reluctant to source from Bangladesh, garments producers are experiencing record losses, shipments are delayed, goods trucks set upon, and ports and roads are frequently closed. No sooner had our economy begun to look up did we manage to successfully become a difficult place to do business. Trips by potential buyers have been cancelled, and lucrative customers like Tesco have said they are thinking twice about considering Bangladesh as an option in the future. Meeting deadlines has meant that air freight cuts into producers’ margins. At this rate, the government’s projection of $28bn from the export sector for the current fiscal year is beginning to look like hubris, bordering on the delusional.",

    "title": "BB plans financial literacy drive for school children",
    "body": "The Bangladesh Bank plans to launch a financial literacy drive to teach school children money management skills, governor Atiur Rahman said yesterday. “The purpose of the programme is to make people understand about financial literacy. The scheme will teach kids money management skills that may be useful for the rest of their lives,” Atiur said while addressing a conference on school banking at the Bangladesh Bank Training Academy. The First School Banking Conference 2013 was jointly organised by the BB and other scheduled banks in a bid to help school children develop saving habits from an early age. Arranging such a conference for the first time is a step towards instilling financial literacy among children, Atiur said. Describing her experiences about school banking, Tangil Choity, a student of class eight at the Vikarunnesa Noon School, said: “School banking helps me develop a saving habit, and prevents me from misusing money. I am saving half of my salami (gifts of money) and daily expenditures given by my parents. I want to use my savings for my higher education.” Sheikh Noor Muktadir, a student of class eight at the Cambrian School and College, said that before becoming an account holder, banking function was a complex issue for him. “But now it is clear to me how a bank operates and provides services,” Muktadir said. Simran Tabasum Ali, a student of class 10 at the Scholastica School, said that her father encouraged her to open a bank account in 2011. “I am now able to use ATM and debit cards, and know about bank statements.” As part of the financial literacy drive, a massive campaign will be carried out through radio, television and newspaper advertisements to provide children and teenagers with financial and banking information in a simple way, Atiur said. He said the basics of handling money and finances will create positive relationships among children and the financial institutions, which will later help them take loans from banks for higher education. “The habit of savings among the kids will also help lessen financial burden of the parents,” he said. The BB website will also put up a web-link on banking issues by posting features, stories and video games so that everyone, from children to the elderly, can gain financial knowledge, said Atiur, urging banks to come forward to make its planned initiative a success. “The central bank will also set up a money museum at the Bangladesh Bank Training Academy so that children can learnabout the history, art and culture of the currencies of other countries,” he said. In 2012, banks had spent Tk3.05bn on their CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities, up by 7.5% over the last five years. Banks are spending 32% of their total CSR activities in the education sector, according to the BB governor. Meanwhile, five private commercial banks - Eastern Bank Limited (EBL), United Commercial Bank, Dutch Bangla Bank, Islami Bank and First Security Islami Bank - were given awards for good performances in expanding school banking across the country. As of March this year, some 45 banks have introduced school banking services and opened accounts for 187,000 students. Their deposits amount to a total of Tk1.14bn, making an average deposit of Tk6,100 per head, according to BB data. In a major decision in November 2010, the central bank asked all banks to open school bank branches, saying students need to be brought under banking services to help them contribute to the country’s economy through savings. EBL was the first bank to start school banking following the BB circular. School banking, however, is not new in Bangladesh. Some banks had introduced school banking as far back as the 1960s,but the schemes did not last long.",

    "title": "Who will speak for the dead? Demand an end to violence",
    "body": "For all our pride and arrogance-filled daily bedroom rants against those who have destroyed our nation, we forget that we are part of the problem. Our tacit acceptance of tragic events and our short-term memory is absolutely unforgivable. This is a democracy. We are as much to blame for the state of our nation as any other actor in the demise of civility as a whole. We no longer value life or truth in any real sense of the words. Both of which must be held as a sacred standard for any developed society to flourish. Why are we not disgusted to the point of doing something, at the death of our brothers, rape of our sisters, murders of officers on duty, killings of innocent citizens and those lost in countless accidents every day? We must re-tune ourselves to the reality that surrounds us and not be as detached as we seem to be at this point in time. We must fight the gamification of violence that pervades every sphere of life in Bangladesh. We can get thousands to demonstrate in Lungis for rickshawallahs in Baridhara, but we can’t gather numbers for people dying every day as a result of political violence? A man dying in Fatikchhari or Fatulla should be as disturbing to us as a neighbour or family member falling victim to a crime. Who will speak for the dead and maimed if we all stay in agreed silence, or pick sides? I have been asked before of what anyone could possibly do in a country like ours, citing countless examples of failed attempts and my response is to keep trying. It is important to not stop until you get a response. We must demand an end to violence. That should be a primary social priority now. Write to your MP and the prime minister. Stage a demonstration truly devoid of political lineage. Take a little bit of time out to open a blog and gather support. Make your voice heard on Twitter. Call your nearest television channel and newspaper and demand they cover your concerns. Make yourself heard on Facebook. Tell ten people you are friends with to voice their concerns daily in some public forum. Call out anyone who directly or indirectly defends violence. Seek nothing but the truth to be recognised, and justice for those who have passed away, and an end to confrontational politics! Seek constitutional reforms that ban such confrontations. Simplify your arguments; ask for an end to the violence, is it really that hard for us to do as a society?That should be a simple enough one point demand. Be a sincere activist; it’s easier now than ever before in our history as a species. Ask yourself why are we a nation that finds it so easy to utilise these matters as a momentary talking point and nothing beyond? At what point, does it all become too much to do something about? Why do we end up politicising the dead? Why, when we gather in historical numbers to demand justice, as we did in Shahbagh, is it that we don’t do so to end the violence in politics, corruption and other substantive matters? You have a choice. Do something about it. Do not let a vocal minority highjack your voice for their own agenda and cite you as an active example of their support base. Remember that as long as we ignore the truth, devalue the dead as a statistic, and do not take an affront to the depreciation of civility, we will carry on blowing out the candles that give our society light.

    "title": "Time for the youth to take the reins",
    "body": "Bangladesh needs you. Yes, I am talking to you - the next generation. When the entire country around us goes down in a tailspin, the onus lies on you and me to pull it back. The older generation has failed to live up to Bangladesh’s founding dreams; you and I need must pull things back together. Such a feat is only possible if we can learn to overcome our differences and work together towards a shared purpose. Nowadays, political conversations are everywhere. More precisely, the political failures. I wonder how much time our intellectuals lose every day talking, debating and analysing differing viewpoints. Maybe I wouldn’t have said ‘lose’ had those conversations resulted in tangible improvements. Unfortunately, it’s still the same old drama, beating about the bush. In moments of such crisis, the younger generation needs to step up. As the torchbearers, we need to find new and non-traditional ways of intervening in the system to clear up this horrible mess. The first step is to create a strong linkage between young people from diverse backgrounds: from different social, educational and religious backgrounds. In today’s Bangladesh, we find significant discrepancies in terms of values, ideals and aspirations among these groups. Unfortunate as that may sound, it is the bitter reality we face. Why is it so hard to imagine youths from different backgrounds come and work together? Has it really become the norm? Can’t we do anything to overcome this initial crucial barrier to bridging the gap? Perhaps the answer lies in exploring and establishing a more tolerant and liberal mind-set. As the former director of a youth leadership institute, I have worked first-hand with English, Bangla and Madrassa students on a common platform. Watching them share the same classroom, engage in meaningful discourse, and participate in team-building activities, I have gained ample insight to believe that a brighter future rests on an inclusive young community. Having said that, I certainly do not state that disparities do not arise. But when they do, those involved should attempt to solve the disparities with respect. Note that the key word here is respect. Imagine a generation that is bound by shared values and where respect is an undertone for any communication. Imagine a society, driven by a united young force, beyond ‘dirty politics’, which is ready to commit time and energy cautiously and effectively. Most importantly, a generation that genuinely cares about the nation’s development. A collaborative approach to learning will help break traditional thinking and create enduring friendships. Friendships that transcend all differences, resulting in a renewed spirit of hope and enthusiasm. In present-day Bangladesh, facilitation of more such platforms is the way forward.

    "title": "The new face of South Asian politics?",
    "body": "Leadership is often overlooked by political scientists when they are analysing historical trends, defining paradigms and charting political economies. But the personality of a leader can actually have a more lasting impact on how things are remembered than any number of statistics. The ideological legacy for good or ill, of Margaret Thatcher for example will not be remembered as vividly as her personality as a powerful woman, the Iron Lady who defended capitalism and enriched several generations of entrepreneurs. Her strength of character and values are her legacy and so it will be with emerging world leaders in the 21st century. No longer are generals and dictators grabbing power and establishing corrupt dynasties, but increasingly, all over the world, democracy in all its shapes and forms is producing leaders who are visionaries, technocrats, pragmatists and most importanly representatives of their people. In Pakistan, for example, the election scheduled for May 11 this year, could see the coming to power of a charismatic leader with potential international stature, if Imran Khan’s party gains the majority vote, as is widely expected. A victory for Imran Khan would herald a new era in South Asian history and a new leadership style and substance that reverses the usual story. Born in Pakistan and having received the best education, Khan became a cricket hero and a society celebrity before turning his back on fame to become a serious politician and philanthropist. Wholly committed to the future of the people of Pakistan, he represents the force for change that Pakistan has been waiting for, reflected by the drop in approval ratings to 14% of the last President, Zardari. Khan does not have a military past to relinquish, nor will he be dazzled by fame and fortune as he has already lived a life of wealth and privilege; cosmopolitan and sophisticated, yet at ease in simple cotton clothes while caring for his farmland, he is comfortable in his own skin and sure of his own faith and destiny. Aware that his country is suffering from a corrupt government and a floundering economy, he has called on the best national and expatriate minds to help craft his policies for the future with teams of experts helping to write his reform agenda. He plans to restructure institutions and infrastructure, solve the energy crisis, spur economic growth, reform the legal system and improve public safety. This is certainly an ambitious agenda but one that can be achieved given national and political will. He also believes that the sectarian and ethnic violence in the country can be ended, by distancing Pakistan from international politics and dealing with terrorism as a national problem. Outspoken against the US drone strikes in the north, he sees them as counter-productive, feeding anti-Americanism and turning more people towards the militants. The potential loss of US aid is not a factor, as it is widely known to be propping up the current political structure, helping to keep it in power. Without international aid, Pakistan will be forced to make reforms and become a more independent and democratic country. Imran Khan’s vision for his country is similar to that of other rising leaders in Muslim countries where colonialism has been replaced by corrupt dictators and authoritarian military leaders, intent on maintaining their own power and prosperity to the detriment of their people. The Arab Spring has shaken their complacency and their overthrow has provided opportunity for a new aspect of politics in countries such as Egypt and Libya and soon, hopefully, Syria. Nobody thinks the transitions will be fast or easy. But, Imran Khan could well become the new paradigm for people-centered politics. Nationalistic, centrist, pragmatic, intellectual and faith-based, new leaders like Imran Khan are the best hope for their countries and the rising generations asking for change. All eyes will be on Pakistan’s election on May 11 and will be hoping for free and peaceful voting with the result the people of Pakistan deserve.

    "title": "Entering the era of anti-politics",
    "body": "Days before things really kicked off at a busy intersection in the capital city, I was sipping tea with some senior journalists at the Sylhet Press Club. I asked my favourite naive question - trying to figure out when people would finally say: “enough is enough.” The journalists I was speaking were most polite as they gently explained that “the passions of 1990” were never going to return, that people had given up on seeing meaningful change, that hope had gone AWOL. The fire had gone out of the young. Apparently, even Zafar Iqbal had thought they were just too besotted with updating Facebook to actually care about anything meaningful. The next day, early afternoon, I watched with astonishment as students from the nearby Shahjalal University of Science & Technology marched through the menacing streets, emptied by the day’s hartal. Half of them were female, many holding hands, perhaps in solidarity, perhaps to suppress fear. The riot police watched with mouths open, some were shaking their heads, others were smiling, I would have loved to know what they were thinking at the time. The students demanded an end to hartals and other agitation, and shouted “Jamaat! Go back to Pakistan!” This was meant to be Sylhet, supposedly a stronghold for Islamists. A couple of days later, Shahbag erupted. Thousands of students, in an “Occupy”-style protest in front of the Shaheed Minar, joined the students of Sylhet, in making their voices heard. These new protesters remained at the Shahbag intersection for weeks in defiance. The genie has escaped the bottle and is clearly reluctant and unwilling to return to oblivion. Some, in the out-of-touch, well-to-do politicised classes in Dhaka, are always just one Islamist march away from hoisting up the white flag. The show of strength before the verdict on Kader Mollah sent shivers down the spines of politicos. When tens and even hundreds of thousands of citizens swept onto the streets all over the nation as a popular counterforce, the so-called secular politicos steadied themselves. With a rebranded Islamist movement burning, looting and maiming, the political tribes have surrendered any shred of moral authority they might have possessed. Who then, speaks for the subalterns, the “subordinates”? 2013 will ultimately be remembered for the anti-politics movements taking centre stage. The Islamist movement is not aiming to be victorious in the next election, even if there were one. There are many ways to capture power. Voting is only one of them. The opposing movement, led by technology, also does not have electoral aspirations. It needs no political programme, no cadres, and no candidates. Its role is that of a catalyst. The two are a symbolic representations of the raging argument that is traumatising the country. Why was Bangladesh created? What should its aspirations be? Which direction does it take? We have to wonder where the subalterns are? The forgotten ones, talked about but not spoken to, ordered around but never consulted, wheeled in for a democratic charade and then dumped outside once the discourse on power actually begins. For those who want genuine national liberation, by reclaiming the sovereignty that leads to shared prosperity - I say, this cannot be an elite-moulded, “ivory tower” project. The dialogue, deliberations and debate have to include the tens of millions in the slums, or “basties,” past and present garments workers, migrants (abroad now and returnees) and the majority who are still involved in agrarian processes. A few years ago, I saw the New Agricultural Movement or Noya Krishi Andolon in action - hundreds of thousands of farmers, who, on a daily basis, defy donor agencies, chemical companies and government. For those either ramping up or fearing Hefazat, they must realise that peasants are more interested in their own work, the seeds they plant and decent prices for their products. They must realise that the millions of female industrial operators from the slums, who have worked in the past or are still toiling away, and their female cousins back in the villages are not weak, “fatalistic”, or timid. That the army of migrants returning from the Middle East have seen how those “petro-sheikhdoms” are run and have suffered at the hands of those barbarous regimes. The majority of these returnees are not eager to recreate those societies here. How many times do the poor have to reject theocratic parties in elections before we show them some respect? Meanwhile, dynastic politicians dig themselves deeper into a hole, unaware that if sidelined this time, they might just never return. The subalterns must be sincerely invited to build this country. The question, naturally, is agency. Eyes need to be cast beyond porous borders for ideas, strategy and depth. While new spaces are opening up for the subalterns, they will have to wait their turn. The immediate consequence of anti-politics is likely to be a Western-backed top-down manoeuvre. Farid Bakht is a political analyst",

    "body": "The government’s decision to nominate Abdul Hamid as its candidate to be the next president of Bangladesh is a good one. From the list of potential Awami League candidates, his name was the least contentious, with the main opposition party also giving him a tacit nod, though it is highly unlikely to participate in the presidential election on April 29. It wouldn’t make more than a symbolic difference if it does, of course. An AL candidate has no chance of losing in an AL-dominated parliament, but soliciting opposition input for something as important as the election of the president would have been an even more welcome move. With much of its senior leadership still in jail, one can understand the BNP’s unwillingness to officially be a part of the election process, but its tacit approval of Hamid is a promising signal. The Awami League itself could and should have gone further as well by attempting to initiate a dialogue with the opposition about candidates, giving them an opportunity to feel included in the process. Since the BNP refuses to speak with the government until its leaders are freed, it may have been futile, but the gesture itself would have been helpful, and the need to seek consensus for the choice of a new president could have served as cover for the government to compromise with the opposition, had it a mind to do so. It was not to be. However, in our current climate of constant and violent brinkmanship, we hope that Abdul Hamid’s nomination for the presidency can be a harbinger of potential compromise and cooperation. With his relative acceptability to the opposition, the presumptive next president can also build bridges and mend fences, and serve as an honest broker between the warring political factions. Abdul Hamid’s nomination for the presidency is thus a postive development and a hopeful sign. But whether he can rise to the occasion or not remains to be seen.",

    "title": "Fresh funds to recapitalise state-owned banks unlikely",
    "body": "The government has no intention yet to inject fresh funds into the state-owned banks, especially Sonali Bank, and bail them out of the fund crunch they were suffering after a recent series of financial scams. “We’ve no intention to fund Sonali Bank,” Banking Division Secretary Dr M Aslam Alam told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday. The largest state-owned bank has been suffering from fund crisis since Bangladesh Bank identified a huge credit scam of around Tk36bn the bank lent to little-known Hall-Mark Group enterprises and few other business houses. “We cannot give fresh fund to the banks as the taxpayers’ money may be drained out through big scam like Hall-Mark,” said the official. He suggested the Sonali Bank authority to take initiative for recovering the money misappropriated through inland bills purchase (IBP). A high official of Bangladesh Bank, however, said the government would have no option but to inject fresh funds to increase the bank’s capital. According to Finance Division, the bank’s total capital at some point stood at around Tk24bn, but the credit scam of Tk36bn affected its fund flow. The bank needs same amount of money for its recapitalisation, officials said. Banking Division sources informed that the government has been trying to arrange a loan from its subsidiary of Sonali Exchange, which is incorporated in the UK. As a state-owned bank, Sonali does not require maintaining the Basel II obligations as the government ensure the guarantee for the depositors’ money of around Tk340bn. Another high official of Bangladesh Bank said that the Hallmark scam has created lack of confident of businessmen on Sonali Bank. As a result, most of the foreign and local commercial banks were not accepting the inland bills from Sonali Bank. “If the government does not inject fresh fund, the clients’ confidence will erode further,” he added. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund, said last month that the government should inject fresh capital into the SoBs to bail them out of the crisis. “Recapitalise the state-owned banks in FY14,” said the multilateral lending agency in a letter to the government, following the visit of its delegation to Dhaka early this month. The IMF also advised the government to formulate a strategy for strengthening the SoBs, including Sonali and BASIC Bank, after making a ‘special diagnosis’ by next June. The IMF team visited here to assess the overall economic situation of the outgoing fiscal year as part of their Extended Credit Facility deal with the government. The team members said that recapitalisation of the SoBs should aim at covering the fund shortage being faced by them. The SoBs have landed in a serious fund constraint after being swindled by certain vested quarters, they observed. The fund embezzlement by Hallmark Group from Sonali Bank’s Ruposhi Bangla Hotel Branch early last year could be described as the single biggest financial fraud in the country’s history. Finance Minister AMA Muhith on February 26 told parliament that eight state-owned specialised and private commercial banks had a total capital deficit of about Tk71.5bn as of September 30, 2012. Officials said the situation deteriorated further as Bangladesh Bank unearthed unreported default loans to the tune of about Tk43.6bn in the four state-owned commercial banks – Sonali, Janata, Agrani, and Rupali.",

    "title": "A road map toward achieving nutrition for all",
    "body": "As we approach the target date of 2015, Bangladesh can be proud of its progress toward the UN’s eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Some goals, such as gender parity in primary and secondary education, have been met ahead of schedule, while others, such as poverty reduction and maternal health, are on track. We’ve seen tremendous improvements in conditions for expecting mothers, for instance, from 574 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 194 in 2011 according to the Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey, 2010. Bangladesh is also among 16 countries recognised by the UN for being on track to achieve the child mortality reduction target. Though progress has been slow, we have also seen positive signs in dealing with the country’s environmental challenges. Where we have faltered in is the area of nutrition. Unfortunately, Bangladesh, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute, is still one of the 36 highest burden countries when it comes to malnutrition, with 36 million people either malnourished or chronically underfed. Alarmingly, about 7.3 million children are stunted, and an unacceptable 53,000 children die each year from preventable complications resulting from chronic malnutrition according to an ICDDRB survey. This is an urgent call to action. We must work together to solve a problem that has many aspects. To start, there is the problem of food security. To feed a population growing by about 2m per year, Bangladesh will require about 27m tonnes of rice by the year 2020, while the total area available for rice production will shrink to 10 million hectares. The Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank stated in 2011 that average rice yields need to increase from the present 2.74 to 3.74 tonnes per hectare. We have seen impressive gains in productivity in the past. Indeed, Bangladesh has come a long way since the 1974 famine, which devastated our country. We have tripled our annual rice production thanks to scientific breakthroughs in agricultural research and sustained outreach to farmers that educated them on adopting diverse crop production. Our efforts through homestead food production programs have succeeded in providing the Bangladeshi people with foods rich in essential vitamins and minerals. We can, and must, continue to move forward in this area. But access to food is just one part of the problem. Another is behavioural. By introducing better infant and young child feeding practices, we can save the lives of millions of children. This includes early initiation of breastfeeding within an hour after birth, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, and breastfeeding combined with appropriate complementary feeding thereafter. Research has shown these practices to have dramatic effects in saving the lives of infants, reducing vulnerability to infections (especially pneumonia and diarrhoea), and preventing stunting (K. Dewey et al, Lancet, 2008). Proper breastfeeding is one of the best ways to combat micronutrient deficiencies, considered the “hidden hunger,” which lead to poor growth, impaired intellect, and susceptibility to infections. But we need to start even earlier in the life cycle, during pregnancy. By providing a new mother with the nutrition her body needs during pregnancy, we protect her baby from most birth and post-birth complications. The consequences of under-nutrition are particularly severe and often irreversible during the critical 1,000 days between the start of a woman’s pregnancy and the child’s second birthday. If we continue giving a child the proper nutrition s/he needs during this 1,000 day window, it can have a lasting impact on the ability to grow, learn, and rise out of poverty. Intervening in the 1,000-day window can shape a society’s long-term health, stability and prosperity. It has shown to positively affect children’s ability to learn, thus increasing their earning potential, while having a lasting impact by increasing a nation’s GDP by 2-3 percent annually says Save the Children. With such evidence, our mandate to act has never been clearer. Having identified some of the many facets of the problems of malnutrition, what are the best and most cost-effective solutions available? The first solution is education. We have to strengthen our formal and non-formal education programmes so that they adequately promote the production and consumption of healthy and adequate meals. We can teach the next generation about the ill effects of malnutrition and how to prevent them by including such topics in our school curriculum. For when children are in school, we can strengthen school feeding programmes in vulnerable areas. We have to educate and encourage communities on proper nutrition for women especially during pregnancy, with diverse calorie rich foods so the mother can remain healthy through pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby. We also cannot ignore the effect of misleading advertisement of food products and must actively work to curb that practice. We must also address the malnutrition problem through proper livelihood training. We can increase the quality of food at the home hearth by training our women to operate fisheries, manage livestock, and engage in poultry rearing and home gardening, for both commercial purposes and household use. We must target these solutions effectively. By lifting the most nutritionally vulnerable populations, such as adolescent girls, pregnant women, and children under 24 months, we can leave a lasting impact on the future of our nation. To prevent nutrition shocks, we should set up a safety net for the nutritionally vulnerable, with special emphasis on disaster response. We also need to consider wider social challenges, such as early marriage and early pregnancy. We must also turn to the coastal regions of Bangladesh, which faces new challenges in drinking water accessibility as salt water contaminates drinking water sources. Evidence suggests a concurrent rise in hypertension prevalence and a resulting increase of eclampsia among pregnant women, which have an eventual impact on a child’s health and nutrition. Finally, we must act globally, for this is not just a matter for Bangladesh alone. That is why I have joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, which seeks to improve maternal and child nutrition and achieve zero hunger worldwide. Founded on the principle that all people have a right to food and nutrition, the SUN movement unites governments, civil society, the United Nations, development partners, businesses and researchers to use their collective effort to improve nutrition. I strongly endorse SUN’s 1,000-day approach. Let us take stock and be proud of the progress we’ve made, especially in Bangladesh – but push on. The problem of malnutrition is an issue of human rights and social justice. By pursuing the action plan outlined above, I believe we can meet the goal of basic nutrition for all.",

    "title": "The Iron Witch",
    "body": "“Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead” reached the number 2 position on the UK music charts propelled by a social media campaign marking the death of former prime minister, Baroness Margaret Thatcher. Whereas, the 1979 song by the punk rock band Netsensibles, “I’m In Love With Margaret Thatcher” only managed 36th position that week. It seems that people love to hate the Iron Lady. I was only 9 years old when Mrs Thatcher went to Number 10. I remember that day. My mom turned to me and said something to the effect of: “Now that there is a woman in charge things will get better for not only Britain but the world.” And in my opinion, it has. To understand her one needs to understand the world that she came to power in. Britain and indeed the world was hit badly by the Opec oil crisis of the early 70s. The Cold War was at its bitter peak. PLO, IRA, ETA, FARC and other such abbreviations held the world at bomb point. The Iranian Revolution was a sign of changing times. In Britain one just needed to hear the popular punk music of the time to figure how disillusioned and dejected the population was. “I want to be an anarchist” sang the Sex Pistols. The British economy was in shambles, with trade unionism at its peak. And as the famous election poster created for the Tory Party by the advertising genius of Saatchi brothers proclaimed: “Labour Isn’t Working. Unemployment was at epidemic proportions. Prime Minister Thatcher changed that. True, unemployment peaked under her leadership but that was part and parcel of the economic reform she started. The guiding principal of Thatcherism was smaller government and a freer economy. Your classical Chicago school model. Let the market decide what the people need and want. The government restricts itself to managing money supply and using only macro-economic interventions. One of her most significant contributions was the mass scale privatisation that she pushed. British Airways, telecom, gas, rail etc that were thought to be services that only the government had the resources to provide, were privatised. This was a model that has since been followed around the world. This act took ailing companies that were a strain on the budget and infused them with entrepreneurial professionalism. Not only did the privatised companies become more innovative and efficient but it also showed the business world that they too could come into and succeed in areas that were earlier thought too daunting. Regardless of which was Mrs Thatcher’s biggest war - Argentina, the coal miners or the Soviets? One thing is for sure, all of them were principled stands and all three are wars she won. She knew that Britain’s pride and identity was in question when Argentina’s military junta occupied the Falkland Islands. Britain sent troops (amongst them the first royal member in modern times to see active military action). Another area of diplomacy was to negotiate the handover of Hong Kong to China where she found a win-win face saving exit. With the coal miners it was a battle against trade unions that controlled Britain’s politics and economy. She always believed in reduced government intervention in business. This is where she made a stand. And by standing firm she sent a message that the economy was paramount. Britain went through a socio-economic upheaval due to this but that was a bitter medicine that was absolutely required to save the patient. Britain ended its role as a leading industrial power but reinvented itself into the financial and service powerhouse, that it is now. Thatcher was one of the first to declare the end of the Cold War. Along with Ronald Reagan and Michael Gorbachev she was instrumental in bringing down the divide that defined the world for 50 years or so, since the fall of Berlin. With her tempered and passionate logic she helped land the world into more peaceful times. This, despite her leading role in convincing President George Bush Sr to send troops in the First Gulf War. Famously quipping: “This is no time to go wobbly. I must confess here, one of her biggest failures was the inability to bring peace in Northern Ireland. Maybe she was effected by a failed IRA assassination plot on her. Thatcher was like any other, not without faults: her authoritarian ways, some of her social policy, the reduction of education funding, and of course the infamous “Poll Tax” that marked the beginning of her end. But in the end Mrs Thatcher left a legacy that still dictates politics and economy across the world. Thatcherism as a principle triumphed. Though people have called it by different names, her true successors was not John Major but rather Tony Blair and in some respects Bill Clinton. Prime Minister Thatcher defined not just centre right politics but politics as a whole. I am sad that the witch is dead",

    "title": "How Shahbagh lost the plot",
    "body": "A week is a long time in politics. In light of this, three months on, it should not be too early to push emotions aside and do a critical analysis of the Shahbagh Gonojagoron Mancha, more casually referred to as “Shahbagh.” Shahbagh started during early February 2013, following the sentence issued by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) of life imprisonment to QuaderMollah. Instant reactions, without any legal analysis of the merits of the judgment, were provided to live television cameras claiming that the judgment was too lenient. Views were expressed and allegations were made that the ICT had, in some way, taken into account the threats of civil war issued by some Islamist groups opposed to the trials. To add fuel to the fire, certain leftist politicians started alluding to the judgment as being the result of collusion between the ruling Awami League and the Jamaat-e-Islam, two parties which, in actuality, are ideological arch-enemies. When a small group of young bloggers and activists started gathering at Shahbag, it was portrayed by the media as being a remarkable reawakening of the people of Bangladesh. These were young people who knew the real history of Bangladesh, and not just the revisionist history fed by successive military and quasi-military regimes. These young patriots had a very simple demand that struck a chord with a vast majority of the nation: the maximum penalty for a person who had been convicted. Thanks to the television channels, press, and social media, the size of the gathering increased from a handful to literally everyone with a conscience who could manage to get to the intersection. Even the honourable prime minister declared on the floor of the parliament that her heart lay with the movement. Three months on, with their immense support fizzling out, we are forced to ask how Shahbagh lost the plot. Despite the initial euphoria, as time went on, citizens started getting annoyed with the traffic congestion that was being caused by blocking one of the main conduits of an already overcrowded city. People started to complain about the insensitivity of holding 24-hour vigils complete with chanting right next to some major hospitals. The movement as a whole was oblivious to the fact that the vast majority of the international community was, in principle, opposed to the death penalty, which constituted their only demand at one point in time. They failed to appreciate the sensitivities of the non-Bengali tribal people by chanting Bengali nationalistic slogans. They may have been naïve to think they would not provide ammunition to those who wished to portray them as anti-Muslim by sitting around flower decorations with candle lights in a manner strikingly similar to some Hindu rituals. The support showed by the Indian government and media did not help either. What started as a simple call for justice turned out to become a more complex demand for banning the fourth largest political party in Bangladesh. Within weeks, the illusion of grandeur got to the leaders at Shahbagh, and they claimed that they were more powerful than the government, because, apparently, the movement truly represented the people. This was a bold contention made by a non-political gathering, whose members had never tested their popularity by running for public office. Shahbagh got overconfident. Its biggest failure was its inability to respect the power, organisation, financial clout, and ability of its key opponents, the Islamist extremists. They failed to counter the propaganda against them orchestrated by these groups. This, other than any other factor, led to its decline and alienation. All good things must come to an end. Unfortunately for Shahbagh, it did not have and still does not have an end game plan.",

Teletalk, the state owned mobile phone operator, says that it will expand its network into the coastal forest soon. “We submitted an application for the Sundarbans after getting a verbal confirmation from the BTRC chairman,” Teletalk Managing Director Mujibur Rahman told Dhaka Tribune. “We’re hoping that we’ll get the permission soon, since we’ve already begun our preparations,” he said. Teletalk officials say this means the country will have 100% mobile phone network coverage. The company will initially begin with three to four tourist hotspots in the forest. “That will be our target initially. After that we can increase coverage phase by phase,” Rahman said. The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world. The Teletalk chief remarked that the company was the first to reach out to many remote areas in the country. In 2008, Teletalk became the first operator to reach the Chittagong Hill Tracts, which include the three remote and hilly districts of Bandarban, Rangamati and Khagrachharhi. Within that year it brought 22 upazilas of those districts under its coverage. Teletalk officials say private operators still rely on Teletalk’s infrastructure to operate in those areas.",

    "title": "Hartals should have no place in our political system",
    "body": "Is it possible to rid our politics of hartals? I put the question to readers when the country is ravaged by a series of hartals, a weapon used indiscriminately by politicians. The destructive power of hartal is immense. It damages both life and property.It hits the economy hard (economists have already downgraded the GDP projection from above 6% to less than that). It brings the normal flow of national activities to a grinding halt. If this practice is so detrimental, why is it allowed to continue? Unfortunately, hartals in the country have been given a life of their own. It has become an entity with fangs, one that is liable to bite anyone that comes near. The small minority of people who use it to their advantage will not allow it to perish. They put all their efforts into assuring that the status quo is maintained. They will shout slogans in the name of the “jonogan,” terming any anti-hartal move tantamount to snatching away their democratic rights. They have venom on their tongues and fire in their eyes. Who would dare challenge them? The “hartalwalas” always claim hartals as a democratic right. Is there any iota of truth to it? In no civilised society of the world, are hartals practiced. It was used in the past during India’s colonial period to drive away foreign rulers. At that point it may have had a place in the political process. However, in an independent country it shouldn’t need to be used. A program which harms other people can never be a democratic right. Hartals are totally undemocratic. These same “hartalwalas” also claim that calling hartals is their constitutional right. It is true that the constitution has ensured the right to express one’s opinions and hold meetings to propagate their ideologies. But the constitution has never given anybody the right to stop others’ movement and prevent them from going about their daily lives. During hartals, as we all know, picketers descend upon the streets and attack innocent passers-by. They set fire to vehicles or hurl bombs at them. They terrorise people, killing and wounding them at whim. Who has given them the right to perform such atrocities? the constitution? No. If the “hartalwalas” have the right to call hartals, others have also the right to reject them. I think we can safely say that the political parties’ activites during hartals are totally unconstitutional. Most people in the country are sick of hartals. They want peace and security. Politicians are apparently only concerned with their own selfish interests instead of keeping the peoples interests first and foremost, although they exercise politics in the people’s name. They make the illegal legal, cashing in on the “janogon’s”interests. Will the politicians stop their fraudulent practices? That applies to both the parties in power and in opposition. The opposition takes delight in calling a hartal and the government party always opposes it. But when the same party gains power, they do the exact same thing. Hartals are a political problem and only the integrity of politicians can solve it. Both parties must come forward to implement a ban. They should stand united to pass a bill in the Jatiya Sangsad to bid farewell to hartals forever. Otherwise, in time, the problem will be taken care of by a fed up “jonogon,” in whose name politics is apparently exercised. Hartals are never wanted, and never necessary. In an independent country it is only a weapon to hurt the nation and make a mockery of people’s expectations. We must abandon this evil if we want to claim that we are civilized and wish to progress. No evil is permanent and one day “hartal” will be a word of the past. Dr Binoy Barman is assistant professor and head of the English department at Daffodil International University.",

    "body": "It is shocking (though hardly surprising) that the AL government would allow activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League to go on a rampage through Mirpur, torching at least 100 vehicles, and terrorising and terrifying the public, after one of their leaders was shot dead, apparently by a local gangster over a feud. Violence during a hartal is bad enough when the opposition calls one, but for a ruling party or its associates to destroy the very peace it is oath-bound to maintain is utterly unacceptable and needs to be condemned in the strongest terms. There is simply no excuse for the government to allow its cadres to unleash this kind of mayhem on the long-suffering public. The BCL violence is no different from the crimes committed by opposition activists during hartals. Indeed, opposition leaders are behind bars as a result of being held responsible for hartal violence. Why should the same standard not be applied to the BCL, or even the ruling party? The AL must put a tight leash on its cadres, and make an example of those who went storming through the city. But that is not sufficient. The leaders who instigated the violence need to be held accountable as well. When the opposition wreaks violence throughout the country, the prime minister harshly decries the violence, and stern action follows. Such incidents are not to be tolerated. But when the government turns around and allows the BCL to riot and destroy at least 100 vehicles when they are aggrieved, with very different consequences, the double standard is lost on no one. The government needs to send the message that violence by any party will not be tolerated. The AL government needs to take full responsibility for the actions of its cadres. The public isn’t stupid, and it won’t continue to take the damage done to it lying down. Enough is enough.",

    "body": "The news that the BNP is considering bringing Zubaida Rahman into the political fold is certainly welcome, and hopefully represents the potential for a sea change in the current political scenario. Many will argue that this is a bad move – a perpetuation of the dynastic political system that has led the country to a point where we are rife with political instability. While we agree that political dynasties are certainly not ideal, we must look at things realistically. Political dynasties exist in our country and in others. One can just look across the border to India, or you could look further afield to the US. If this is the reality we face, the best we can hope for is that those who come forth from these families are genuinely concerned about the country and capable of improving the nation’s situation. This is where Zubaida comes in. A doctor by training, she has the educational and analytical background that would allow her to do well in our discordant political system. It is also possible that she could act as a bridge between the ruling and opposition party, as she is widely accepted, and more importantly, respected. It also suggests that BNP can still make smart, insightful decisions. It is apparent that they have finally heard the people and come to the realisation that the public would not appreciate Tarique Rahman taking over from his mother. We, as a nation, should hope that Zubaida comes into the fray on her own terms. Our biggest fear should be that Zubaida, as either lackey or puppet, would continue and maintain our political status quo. As a newcomer to our political landscape, she should bring in new ideas and party policies which would allow the nation to work past our current deadlock.",

    "title": "Of daring, deadlocks and fractious politics",
    "body": "So, let’s have a history test – how many can recall a major turbulent event of 1930 linked to the independence movement of the subcontinent? To give another hint: the exact date is April 18, 1930. If the date and the clue mean nothing, and fails to stir your memory, it’s alright. We forget events like the mass upsurge of 1990, the demands it vocalised and the emotions it evoked, so, in that context, 1930 is a long way off. But those who do remember or, want to have their memories refreshed, on that day, Masterda Surya Sen, a firebrand revolutionary stormed the Chittagong Armoury, looted weapons, declared Chittagong free from imperial rule, giving hope (no matter how small) to the aspiration of driving out the British from India. As train and telegraph lines were cut off, Chittagong remained detached from Calcutta, fuelling dreams of the first area to be independent of foreign domination. Of course, this liberty was short-lived; anything else would have been a miracle! A few die hard nationalists took on a mighty empire – it was simply a case of David against many Goliaths. In time, reinforcements from the Raj came, the revolutionaries took refuge in the Jalalabad Hill and, eventually, after a series of fatal skirmishes, the living freedom fighters dispersed to fight another day. Now, many may call the act of Sen and his comrades foolhardy to the extent that it was sheer madness, but it shook the core of the empire because the notion that a handful of people would dare challenge an empire never even occurred to anyone. In practical terms it was lunacy to declare war on a power which claimed (correctly, at that point in time) that the sun never set in her mighty empire. But despite the odds, the men did it! They did not manage to hold on to a Chittagong for long but showed that nothing is impossible. Fast forward to 2013, today, Bangladesh is faced with another crisis – one which seems insurmountable due to the obduracy/wicked intentions of political entities. With elections around six months away there isn’t a political consensus, the war crimes tribunal has polarised a large section of society with a very sensitive issue of secularism thrown in the melee. Playing the religion card in the sub-continent is always a tricky matter because one false move will send the message that religion is under jeopardy. No offence meant, but general people everywhere, usually form opinion based on perceptions. Therefore, if there is a feeling that religion is victimised, political instincts take a secondary seat. But, the current problems are nothing that cannot be solved. No mammoth force is against us; what is needed is just the will power/good intention to sit for a dialogue. If Surya Sen could take up an impossible mission, why can’t our politicians be a little less rigid for an acceptable way out of the current crisis? It’s indeed unfortunate that we have to remember Sen and the daring exploits of his intrepid men and women at a time when the country is held hostage under a deliberately created cacophony. Naturally, the memory of Sen and his men deserve more. For good reason, the days for taking up weapons to initiate change are superseded by a peaceful process of constructive dialogue; however, both ways have something in common – the inherent desire to end social/political ailments. With non-stop strikes, the country’s image is being severely dented but the worst part is people have begun to question the evolution of democracy since the fall of the autocratic regime in 1990. Twenty years may not be a long time but in an age of globalisation where changes need to come swiftly, politics is Bangladesh is still governed by selfish motives. With the current state of affairs, the AL and the BNP are at loggerheads, with smaller parties astutely exploiting certain social events to exacerbate the scenario. Just recently, a very practical solution by Transparency International Bangladesh for an all party special committee to oversee the polls was turned down. But it’s evident that the opposition will not go to election unless they feel there is a certain degree of neutrality in the poll time administration. A little elaboration is needed here: maybe for other countries, holding elections under an incumbent government would not have sparked such fierce emotions, but everything said and done, this is Bangladesh. Pardon me for saying this: all parties have been found to take actions to solely serve their interests across a broad spectrum of social/political settings. All governments target known supporters of other parties, the student wing of a ruling party remains gleefully above law, unleashing a reign of terror, postings to foreign embassies are handed out on allegiance basis, party affiliation is considered mandatory for promotion – the list of aberrant political behaviour can go on and on. Yes, let me say this again: this disease afflicts all sides! Lamentably, our democratic progression, zealously enshrining all these not so redeeming qualities, hasn’t evolved to a state so as to infuse confidence in having an election under a political government. At such a juncture, an arrangement is needed and not arbitrary decisions. For heaven’s sake, let’s not forget that authoritarian moves have never ended well for Bangladesh. The Chittagong Armoury Raid in 1930 may have been an armed rising but the political ideology behind it was simple – free the country from an imperial power, be our own masters. Regrettably, more than ninety years later, we have not overcome the self-destructive traits. The world no longer has any place for military imperialism and former ruling countries often have to apologise for the their past policy of suppression but how do we reconcile the current vicious political trends with the deeds of those who believed that ridding the country of foreigners would surely bring peace?

    "body": "The Export-Import Bank of USA is willing to finance 85% of the total cost of Bangabandhu-1 satellite under a supplier’s credit arrangement. The bank wrote to Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission recently, expressing the interest to fund around Tk25 billion for the Tk30 billion project - already approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC). The rate of interest is proposed to be less than 2%. It is the first proposal from any prospective financier. The government was trying to get external fund supports since the project was conceived. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunication forwarded the proposal to the ministries of finance and planning for their consideration, secretary of the ministry Md. Abubakar Siddique told the Dhaka Tribune. “We cannot take decision on any foreign credit proposal for a project approved by the ECNEC,” he added. BTRC officials were not, however, convinced whether the credit term was soft as many aspects of the proposal have not been verified until yesterday. According to the proposal, BTRC could choose any vendor from USA, Canada and Europe. Bangladesh has already signed a non-binding agreement with a Russian satellite company, Sputnik, on 119 East degree of the space, amid objections to 102 degree slot for the satellite from around 20 countries including USA, Russia, France and Australia. Officials said BTRC will have to spend $35m for the orbital slot for a single life time of 15 years. “After signing a non-binding agreement in March this year, we are now in the second phase to finalise the deal with Sputnik,” said one of them, requesting anonymity. At the same time, BTRC is trying to get its own orbital slots on 102 degree and 69 degree east. It also expressed interest for another slot of 135 degree east to ITU (International Telecommunications Union) though it is very far from Bangladesh coverage. “We’re trying for our own orbits as well amid lots of objections,” BTRC chairman Sunil Kanti Bose told the Dhaka Tribune recently. Bangladesh spends around $11 million annually on satellite rents for running television channels, telephones and radios. If Bangladesh can successfully launch the satellite, it will earn $50m through renting out the unused portion every year. Neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar could become the users. “Though India has its own satellites, it can be a market for us too,” an executive of consulting firm Space Partnership International (SPI) said.",

    "title": "The perils of the retail investors in Bangladesh",
    "body": "The Bangladesh stock market is still in an infant stage when we consider the maturity of investors, the quality of corporate disclosures and the strength of the regulators. Therefore, it is no wonder that the market in Bangladesh is highly driven by momentum where investors have short holding periods. In the short run, the market tends to act like a zero sum game. If someone wins, someone else has to lose. This is the perfect situation for the slaughter of small retailers. Let us go through the problems one by one: Quality of earnings and financial disclosures The first major problem is related to the “quality of earnings” and the level of financial disclosures. Quality of earnings refers to the sustainability and trustworthiness of earnings numbers. At present, other than a handful of listed companies, it is very difficult for knowledgeable investors to trust the financial statements. The blame, to some extent, goes towards the auditing firms. However, the first step in preparing clean and transparent financial statements has to be taken by the companies themselves. Secondly, the accessibility to financial statements is a big problem in itself. Many of the companies do not have websites, and even if they do, the statements are not uploaded in due time. The solution to this problem is to upload statements in the stock exchange websites. Without access to trustworthy and timely financial statement it is not possible to do fundamental analysis. Insider trading refers to the trading of shares by people who have access to material news flow, like earnings and dividends, before they are disclosed to general investors. Examples of such investors would be company management, audit firms, company directors etc. This harms the retail investors who get the news flow only after it has already been priced into the share. The problem lies in the lack of a strong legal framework, along with the enforcement of such laws. For example, if a person earns Tk10m from insider trading and is fined Tk100 thousand, he will happily pay the fine. Therefore, in order to discourage insider trading, the scale of the punishment has to be increased by a large magnitude. We do realize that the regulators might not have adequate manpower to catch all cases of insider trading. However, even if they could set some examples by penalizing few high profile cases, that should work as an example to others. Pump and dump strategies: Next, we have pump and dump strategies. By cornering shares (reducing liquidity) and spreading rumors, some manipulators jack up the stock prices in order to dump their holdings on to the unsuspecting retail investors. As the stock market is a sensitive issue, regulators and governments are sometimes afraid to take steps against market manipulators for fear of the market coming down. In the short run, that is a possibility. However, in the long run, these steps would be much more beneficial to all the stakeholders. Lack of knowledge of investors The lack of knowledge of retailers, and even some institutional investors, is also a problem. Even today, stock bonus is considered to be something great and causes stock prices to go up significantly. When the target victims are not smart enough and need to rely on rumors to make money, they are likely to lose money in the stock market. The players who will continue to make money will be the “insider trader” and the “large retailer” because of information and capital advantage. If these guys continue to make money, then someone else will lose it. Lack of transparency in asset management industry The stock market is not for everyone. Not everybody has the time to study or learn it. Therein lays the importance of professional fund management. However, the present state of the managed fund business would deter most of the investors who would like to give funds for professional management. Before giving funds to a management company, an investor needs to look at its track record, investment strategy, background of fund managers and top holdings. None of this information is available in Bangladesh. However, by not promoting transparency, not only are many investors forced to take a shot at investing by themselves based on rumors, the asset management industry is also not growing as much. In such a situation, the chances for retail investors to make money will be limited. In the short run, the momentum chasing strategies could work out, but eventually the investor is likely to make losses. We should not let the stock market turn into another tool for redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich. In a country where saving instruments are limited, the role of the stock market is crucial. Before everything else, we need to focus on corporate governance, minority shareholder rights and quality of auditing.",

    "title": "MCCI seeks tax cut across the board",
    "body": "Metropolitan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) yesterday requested the revenue authorities to reduce import duties across the board to help grow the local trade and industries. They recommended reducing the duty on capital machinery, industrial raw materials, intermediate goods and finished goods at a pre-budget meeting with National Board of Revenue (NBR) at its headquarters in Dhaka. NBR Chairman Ghulam Hossain chaired the meeting. In case of capital machinery, they want the duty should be 1.5% from 3% while cutting it to 2.5% for raw materials from 5%, intermediate goods from 12% to 7.5% and finished products from 25% to 20%. The duty-cut was one of the 73-point charter of demands they placed before the NBR for their consideration to accommodate in the budget for the next fiscal year. Adeeb H Khan of MCCI placed few of the proposals that included 43 on income tax, 6 on customs act amendment and 24 on amendment of Value Added Tax act 1991. The chamber also suggested removing the 5% regulatory duty at import stage of some basic raw materials and intermediate goods. It demanded reducing the Advance Income Tax to 3% from existing 5%. The chamber urged the NBR to renew the income tax incentives being enjoyed by the seven sectors such as apparel, jute, handmade products, newly set up industries, newly constructed physical infrastructure, poultry, fisheries and livestock. The incentives expire this year, it pointed out. It wanted to extend the tax rebates and other benefits being enjoyed by the local software to the imported software too. It sought changes in the rule that imposes income tax on associations. They asked NBR to do some amendments in Value Added Tax act 1991 and its relevant SRO’s. MCCI president Rokia Afzal Rahman said the prevailing political unrest has cast negative influence on economic activities of the country, affecting the expected economic growth. She said that import expenditure declined 7% in the first eight months of the current fiscal year while capital machinery imports dropping alarmingly by 18.5% and other machinery imports by 10.2%, indicating poor investment in the economy. She stressed the need for a strong social safety net programme for the industrial and agricultural sectors. “We expect that the government will formulate a comprehensive budget, which will promote industrial inertia, increase employment opportunities and expand trade and commerce,” she added. The NBR chairman said that the situation does not allow imposing new taxes. “But if we reduce all the taxes, how could we collect revenue for the coming years,” he told the meeting. He also said that NBR has a plan to initiate automated audit system which would help ensure transparency, but it would take time.",

    "title": "Rahul vs Modi: Are you entirely sure about that?",
    "body": "Elections to India’s parliament for the next national government should be held around this time next year, if the present government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh completes its full term. That, however, is starting to look unlikely, since the government is already in a minority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. It is surviving on outside support from a number of sometimes whimsical allies, such as the Samajwadi Party led by Uttar Pradesh politician Mulayam Singh Yadav. Mr Yadav has begun predicting elections later this year. That’s not a good sign for Mr Singh’s government, since he holds the rug the government is standing on. The fact that the government is on shaky ground has not escaped any political party, or the loud and very active Indian media. The country, therefore, is moving into election mode. Television debates on the country’s main news channels are being accompanied by charts showing the numbers commanded by each party in Parliament. Talk everywhere, in media, social media and business circles, frequently turns to questions of who will be the next prime minister of India. At present, that question is usually met with answers naming Gujarat Chief Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi, 62, or Sonia Gandhi’s son, Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, 42. The elections are being billed as a showdown between these two individuals. Both scenarios are, in my opinion, rather far-fetched. Neither the BJP nor the Congress has declared its prime ministerial candidate. Both parties have been asked the question a few thousand times by now, and consistently refused an answer. Moreover, at least one of the presumptive candidates, Rahul Gandhi, has himself indicated on countless occasions that he is not in the race for the prime minister’s post. It is quite likely that neither of them will become the next prime minister of India. The country’s political map offers clues to why. Mr Modi, who has a reputation of being a very good administrator, is weighed down by what even his most ardent supporters describe as a terrible administrative lapse: the Gujarat riots of 2002, in which thousands of Muslims were killed in mob violence. His opponents and detractors have always charged Mr Modi with being complicit in the riots and ensuring the police did not get in the way of the mayhem. As a result, despite all his wonderful work in burnishing the Gujarat economy, he remains unacceptable to most members of minority communities in India, and to secular Hindus, who are arguably the majority. Rahul Gandhi, as the alternative, also leaves voters in many parts of India unimpressed. This has been proved by the results of his campaigning efforts in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are of great electoral significance because they send 120 members to Parliament. Gandhi expended much time and energy on campaigning during local assembly elections in those states, but his Congress party’s performance barely showed a blip. The fact of the matter is that every state in India has its own politics, with its own leaders who, on their turf, count for more than any “national leaders. So, the politics in Uttar Pradesh is primarily a contest between Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, and Dalit leader Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party. In Bihar, it is mainly between Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) and Lalu Prasad Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal. In West Bengal, it is between Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress and the Left parties. In Tamil Nadu, it is between J Jayalalitha’s party and K Karunanidhi’s. And so on, in state after state across the union. What this means is that neither the BJP nor the Congress actually has much of a chance in roughly half the country. They are basically fighting for the remaining half. It is rather unlikely that either of them will have a success rate so high that they manage to win more than 200 seats on their own in the 545 member Lok Sabha. At the present moment, it seems to me that neither of them will get much more than 150 or 160 seats out of 545. This means that the regional parties may actually be the largest group in a hung Parliament. They are currently too divided to cobble together a government, but given a stable nucleus, they could pull together to form one, possibly with outside support from the Congress or the BJP. Or, the reverse may happen, where one of the two “national parties leads a rainbow coalition. In either case, Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi would make for very unlikely prime ministers. Rahul would probably not want to lead such a government, and Modi would not be acceptable to several parties. That leaves the field to candidates with wide acceptability across the political spectrum - people like the unlikely politician who’s been PM for two terms, Manmohan Singh.

    "title": "RMG sector loses $2.65m due to unrest",
    "body": "Depicting a gloomy picture of the ready made garments (RMG) sector and huge losses caused by frequent shutdowns, frustrated leaders of the apparel sector today renewed their request to political parties to refrain from enforcing hartals for the sake of the economy. “Relieve us of hartal…You’re not seeing our internal bleeding. It seems that the industry (RMG) is being strangulated to death,” BGMEA president M Atiqul Islam told a joint press conference at the BGMEA conference room. He urged the political parties to resolve the political crisis politically, as soon as possible to save the highest export-earning sector in the country, UNB reported. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) and Bangladesh Textiles Mills Association (BTMA) jointly arranged the press conference to share the disastrous scenario of the readymade garment industry following political instability. BKMEA president AKM Selim Osman, first vice president M Hatem, BTMA president Jahangir Alamin, former BGMEA vice president M Siddiqur Rahman and directors of the BGMEA were present. The leaders said the economy and politics will have to move together and the country’s further development is not possible by shattering the economy. Speaking at the press conference, Selim Osman said, “We’re surprised to see street politics and violence despite the existence of a democratic government. We urge all to take initiatives to reach a consensus and relieve us.” Responding to a question, he said they are apolitical. “We can’t come down to the streets. We had talks with the prime minister and we’ll meet the opposition leader too and place our proposals.” He said the businesspeople can only make requests but they cannot force or put pressure on the political parties on any issue. Jahangir Alamin said, “Political leaders will have to find out the mechanism to resolve their crisis politically. And it’ll have to be done very quickly.” He said the political leaders should realise it and hoped that they will help keep the wheel of the economy moving. A one-day hartal hampers production worth about Tk20m and export orders worth US$ 2.565m have been cancelled due to hartal while the amount of discount on the export was $1.132m due to the same reason. The BGMEA president said the air shipment amount was Tk3m and the shipment worth $9.3m got delayed due to hartal. “The data came from a survey on 32 factories.” The RMG buyers are not coming to Dhaka reflecting security concerns. “At present, buyers are suggesting us to negotiate orders by going abroad. It’s the peak time to get orders. If we don’t get export orders, the factories will remain idle in the coming months,” BGMEA president Atiqul Islam said. He said a message is being sent out that violence and deaths are occurring in Bangladesh and there is no political stability. “The country’s image is being tainted.” Atiqul Islam also said the buyers are shifting their export orders to alternative destinations. “Recently, Vietnam saw 22 percent export growth while Cambodia 15 percent.” The BGMEA president said Bangladesh can boost its export volume to US$ 50bn if they get support from the government and a business-friendly environment. “We’re in the second position in the global apparel market. We’re trying to be the number one. To make that happen, we need support from all fronts.”",

    "title": "Dhaka, Colombo form 2 working groups to boost trade",
    "body": "Two joint working groups on trade and shipping were launched yesterday to tap the potentials of enhanced trade and connectivity between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The joint working group on trade is expected to start work within two months. This was agreed when the Bangladesh Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque and Sri Lankan Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs Karunatilaka Amunugama met on Monday at Colombo at the second Foreign Office Consultation, UNB reported quoting a foreign ministry message received here yesterday. The two foreign secretaries reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations, and took stock of the progress made in implementing decisions made during the visit of President Rajapaksa to Bangladesh in 2011 and at the 4th Joint Economic Commission in 2012. Both sides agreed to reduce tariffs at a faster rate, remove non-tariff barriers and para-tariff measures, and rationalise sensitive lists under multilateral frameworks like South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta). Safta is an agreement of SAARC states signed on January 6, 2004 in Pakistan’s Islamabad. Under the agreement, a free trade area, comprising of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka was made. The seven foreign ministers signed a framework agreement to reduce customs duties of all traded goods to zero by the year 2016. The Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan foreign secretaries also agreed to launch discussions on a trade framework, beginning with a short-list of economically meaningful items for greater preferential market access, which could be expanded within an agreed time to form the basis for a possible FTA. Both sides agreed to accord greater emphasis on enhanced maritime connectivity between Bangladesh and Sri Lankan ports. A Sri Lankan delegation will visit Bangladesh soon to discuss all the related issues, including the enhancement of cargo, incentives and discounts of port charges, the possibility of coastal shipping, and other preferential treatments. Given the interest of Sri Lanka to import medicines, the two foreign secretaries agreed to facilitate early conclusion of an arrangement on supply of emergency medicines under a government-to-government arrangement. They also agreed to explore government-to-business collaboration in pharmaceuticals. Sri Lanka would welcome a pharmaceutical sector delegation from Bangladesh to Sri Lanka soon to discuss all the issues to facilitate trade and investment in this sector. The two Foreign Secretaries also considered ways and means to enhance collaboration in the areas of culture, vocational training, and agriculture. They also discussed the possibility of higher-level bilateral visits in the future. Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque is scheduled to pay courtesy calls on President Mahinda Rajapaksa Tuesday.",

    "title": "Political chaos forces investment plans to shelve",
    "body": "Local and foreign investment plans have been shelved due to prolonged political uncertainties in the country, putting a dent on the economic growth. World’s top clothing brands like Tesco, Walmart, H&M, C&F, VF and Celio have already decided to give up their investment in Bangladesh because of the political uncertainties, said a local entrepreneur. “It's difficult to forecast, it’s difficult to plan as we don’t know where we are now,” Evince Group Chairman Anwar ul Alam Chowdhury told the Dhaka Tribune. The political chaos is a common scenario ahead of every general election in Bangladesh. But this time the political upheaval might take longer as political parties have been entangled with several issues, scaring away investors. Business in Bangladesh is facing a series of strikes since February this year, hindering business activities and sending negative signals to other countries. “The longer the political uncertainty will persist, the more companies will hold off investment, affecting the economic growth that is needed to improve the living standards of the people,” said AK Azad, former president of The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI). The entrepreneur deferred a Tk5bn denim project due to political upheaval. He informed that many foreign entrepreneurs diverted their investment plan for China, Myanmar and Vietnam. “This is very bad news for our economy,” he said. “Higher interest rates, unfriendly loan classification policy and cancellation of new gas connection have already slowed down the investment,” said Abdus Salam Murshedy, managing director of the Envoy Group, one of the country’s largest apparel manufacturers. “Political uncertainties add to our woes,” said the president of Exporters' Association of Bangladesh. No textile millers go for investment in 2013 due mainly to cancellation of gas connections and political uncertainties, according to Jahangir Alamin, president of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association. Bangladesh’s economy, which sailed relatively unscathed through the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, might head back towards annual growth of below 6%, latest forecasts suggest. “Things might turn worse if political uncertainties take longer,” said Dr Mirza Azizul Islam, finance adviser to the last caretaker government. The growth of investment – a prerequisite for economic growth--remained stagnant at around 24% over the last several years, he said. The overall investment growth needs to be more than 28% to achieve 7% GDP growth, he said. The International Monetary Fund in its latest World Economic Outlook forecasts that Bangladesh’s GDP growth this year will fall to 6%. Earlier, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank also forecast that the GDP growth will be less than 6% in the current fiscal (2012-13) due to political turmoil and the sluggish world economy. The figure falls far short of the target of 7% estimated for the current fiscal year. The contribution of overall investment to GDP growth remained negative since 2008. The investment proposal registered with Board of Investment (BoI) declined more than 30% to Tk6bn in first eight months of current fiscal year compared to the previous year, BoI data showed. According to the Bangladesh Bank data, the private sector credit growth fell 13.96% year-on-year in February on the back of declining imports and political unrest. The overall import (based on settlement of letters of credit) growth fell to 11.07% during the July-February period of the current fiscal against 13.62% growth in the corresponding period of previous fiscal, it said. Analysts held the ongoing political standoff responsible for the fall in private sector credit growth and import growth as businesses shy away from making any new investments amid a fall in industrial production and trade.",

    "title": "The war of brutal videos and our handicapped conscience",
    "body": "Several brutal videos of public lynching of different political activists are making their rounds in the social media scene of Bangladesh. Of the several gruesome videos available, one clip, shot in October 2006, shows the killing of a Shibir activist at Paltan during the infamous Logi Boitha rally called by the current prime minister. Several people were beaten to death that day, this one just happens to be recorded. It is clear from the audio narrative of the clip that one of the parties involved in the current conflict, Shibir, is mourning this death of their activist and alleging that AL activists committed this heinous and gruesome act at the direct order of Sheikh Hasina. Jamaat-e-Islami and their allies often bemoan this and have long been demanding justice for this mindless public lynching. In the last 7 years, no Awami League, 14 party, and so called pro 71 forces activists and leaders were seen to express sorrow at this killing and demanding justice. It seemed many even enjoyed the logi boitha killing as the elimination of a poisonous snake. Although the video clearly shows the perpetrators, no attempts have been made to bring them to justice. Another such video shows how a local government leader, Upazilla Chairman Sanaullah Noor, was chopped to death. Noor, belonging to the opposition party, brought out a rally at the main thoroughfare of the upazilla. In broad daylight, in front of thousands of onlookers and dozens of journalists, a few dozen activists of the ruling party, armed with hatchets, axes, sticks, knives attacked the procession. As the procession dispersed, the attackers converged on the leader. As could be seen in the video, the attackers kept beating Noor, even when he fell down, bleeding profusely and begging for his life. It was also reported that at one point, some attackers used knives to cut major blood vessels in his arms and tendons in his legs. According to news reports, the group of assailants was led by Zakir Hossain, a local AL leader. At one point in the video Zakir is seen chasing a journalist who had been attempting to take photos of the killing. Nearly a dozen journalists were brutally beaten during this event and were admitted to local hospitals. Before any investigation or charges could be brought up, a statement from the ruling party claiming that the killing might be a result of BNP’s infighting, buried any hope of a fair investigation or any justice. The suspected lead killer remained free of any harassment of law enforcement agencies. It was reported that he used state-backed power to rig the results of the election for upazilla chairman which went vacant after the death of Noor. And over the last two and a half years, the state was not seen taking any tangible steps toward investigating the murder. The last video that caught my attention was taken in Fatikchhari, Chittagong. Islami Chhatra Shibir enforced a general strike and the local unit of the ruling party organised an anti-hartal rally. The rally met resistance from Shibir activists, and altercations began – police remained inactive despite requests by rally-goers to intervene. Apparently the AL rally, was overwhelmed by Shibir activists who were re-inforced by local villagers. All the motor bikes belonging to the AL activists were burnt to ashes before three AL activists were trapped in a local school and subsequently lynched – they were beaten and chopped to death in a fashion similar to the other two men in the other two videos. Their cries for help, were clearly audible in the background. However, unlike the other two killings, this stirred the emotions of our prime minister, the whole pro 71 brigade and secular liberals. Social media scenes as well as print media scene were filled with heart wrenching laments. Mainstream newspapers published multiple follow up stories of the event and about the identity of the perpetrators. The PM as well as many of the commentators immediately compared the brutal Fatikchhari lynching with Pakistani army brutality in 1971. The whole brunt of the state swept heavy-handed over the locality and, under curfew, combing operations were conducted and every single possible suspect including the local government chairman were arrested and sent to police torture/interrogation cells. And in a complete reversal of roles – BNP, Jamaat and their allies remained quiet about the killings. As the AL, and centre left secular liberal forces and pro ‘71 Chetona brigade felt rather happy about the first two lynchings described earlier, the centre right conservative spectrum secretly felt satisfaction at this horrendous act. In 1994, killing groups of Rwandan Hutus, supported by the Hutu-led government and army, took up machetes against their ethnic Tutsi neighbors. They started chopping men, women and children to death. By the end of the week, 500,000 to 1m ethnic Tutsis were dead. In Bangladesh, except a small proportion of religious and ethnic minorities, 90% of the population are not divided by any ethic, religious or language barriers. We are all more or less homogenous with regard to culture, religion, race, creed, language. Yet an artificial division is driving us towards this Hutu-Tutsi type bloodthirsty animosity. In the Rwandan conflict a big chunk of the victims were moderate Hutus who tried to bring some sense and refused to take part in the mindless brutal chopping of their Tutsi neighbors. In Bangladesh we are also seeing intense polarisation, forcing moderates to be with or against a side. We are letting our political faith triumph over our basic human instincts. Ultimately, humanity loses out. Rumi Ahmed is a blogger and political analyst.",

In practice, a trade is not a trade if it does not develop and institutionalise both its internal system and public image. The print media industry is no different; it has to develop just as any other trade or business practice. While internal processes may vary by organisation, the industry has done well in making itself indispensable to the public. They have built a mass culture in which the nation’s citizens need the industry’s output, namely the newspaper, as they need their morning cup of tea. In other words, the paper has been able to create – by harnessing people’s basic instincts of curiosity and thirst for knowledge – and then tap into a culture where people want to know what happens around them and how they are governed. In essence, this culture is what democracy is all about, and the point naturally veers around to the question of the relation between democratic governance and the role of newspapers. Ideally, the democratic system of governance is run on the basis of participation and consensus, which depends on making sure that there are few, or no, information gaps: information is key. The most common and widely used vehicle in this information-sharing process is the newspaper. Of course there are plenty of other modes of communication, such as radio, television, online news outlets and social media. Amongst all of these mediums, the newspaper remains the most effective and convenient. Newspapers vivify the socio-political landscape of a country by, on the one hand, objectively reporting on political, social and economic national matters, while, on the other hand, providing context to the news by reflecting upon. They serve the public by constantly keeping the public informed and helping form public opinion. There is a reason that newspapers are referred to as an estate within the state. In its coverage of a wide variety of subjects, newspapers cannot help but be generational as well as cosmopolitan. People, according to their interests (generational and otherwise), use the newspaper as a means to become aware of daily happenings; it educates them through cultural orientation and enlightenment. Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, branded the indispensability of newspapers with the following words: “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” Professor Dr Nurul Islam is Vice Chancellor, Eastern University.",

    "title": "The post-American world",
    "body": "In a unipolar world order, the term post American world remains quite novel to an average person. Many may question the practicality of a world order devoid of US influence and dominance. Since the close of the second world war, the US has maintained its dominance over the world by combining its military might with economic power. The Twin Tower attacks changed all that. America, long considered invincible, was floored by the audacity and reach of Al Qaeda. The attack subsequently forced them to undertake military action in Afghanistan. That campaign was followed by another in Saddam’s Iraq, which had a heavy toll on US military spending, which still has the US reeling. So what should the post-American world look like? Is the American economy already on the decline? Fareed Zakaria, a renowned US journalist, portrays this phenomenon in his book, The Post-American World, as the rise of the rest, instead of the fall of America. The principal challenger is China and, to some extent, India. Both countries have been experiencing spectacular economic growth riding on the secondary sector and tertiary sectors in China and India, respectively. Following the removal of its self-imposed isolation in the second-half of the 20th century, the Chinese government has been working judiciously towards improving its economic growth. The government has been incentivising MNCs to set up their factories through a set of investment policies favouring foreign investors. As a result, courtesy of low-cost labour, cheap Chinese goods have successfully penetrated the world market, allowing the country to further strengthen its economy. China currently boasts the world’s second largest economy. Growth in the Chinese economy continues and it is expected that it will become the largest economy by 2020, surpassing the US. Although China’s foreign policy motto remains “peaceful rise,” their economic clout has afforded them to become more active in world affairs. The focus of their foreign policy remains securing mineral resources for the burgeoning manufacturing industry. In terms of military technology and strength, China remains far behind the US, with no foreseeable change. Given this backdrop, the Americans find themselves in a difficult position facing a rising China. Both countries have recently been at loggerheads over China’s “Senkaku Island” land dispute with Japan. Because of changing dynamics, the US is now shifting its focus to Asia. India is a potential ally for countering China’s influence. It will be interesting to see how things pan out, as the future of the so-called post-American world will depend on the interactions between China and the US.

    "title": "Rewards and punishment for winners and losers",
    "body": "Since the passage of the 15th amendment to the constitution on June 30, 2011, abolishing the caretaker government (CTG) system, public debate has centred around the form of government under which the next parliamentary elections will be held; whether it should be a non-party CTG as demanded by the BNP-led opposition or the incumbent government going into a caretaker mode with an independent Election Commission as proposed by the AL-led ruling alliance. Over the last 20 months, both the government and the opposition have remained inflexible in their respective public stands on this issue. The opposition has threatened to boycott the elections, and has engaged in hartals and street mobilisations, which are turning increasingly more violent. Civil society, professional groups and ordinary citizens are pleading that the two sides engage in dialogue and come to a peaceful negotiated settlement about the possible shape of an election-time government. While an agreement about the composition of a government under which the next parliamentary elections will take place is necessary, what is more important is to come to an agreement about how the winners will treat the losers after the elections. Unless both sides make a genuine commitment that they will give up their “winner takes all” style of politics, stop abusing each other in parliament, and shun violence as a means of settling inter-party differences, simply having another round of free and fair elections with strong participation will not solve our problems. We need to understand why, before each parliamentary election, we face such uncertainty and crises. Elections determine who will be the winners and who will be the losers. In every country winners get rewarded. But in a democracy the losers need not fear punishment. Unfortunately in Bangladesh, the winners are disproportionately rewarded. They get to monopolise the distribution of public resources. They can break laws without worrying about accountability. The losers, on the other hand, get frozen out of all official patron-based distribution systems, which are the lifeblood that keeps political parties alive. More significantly, the losers face various forms of harassment and oppression. The opposition leaders and workers have to fight a plethora of legal cases lodged against them, some trivial and some serious, which require repeated court appearances and sometimes result in prison terms. They get beaten up when they try to organise street protests and agitation programmes. They also run the risk of getting killed. For example, during 2001-2006 several opposition members of parliament were assassinated and grenade attacks on an opposition meeting nearly killed the then leader of the opposition who is now the prime minister. At present, most of the top leaders of the opposition, including the general secretary of the major opposition party, are in prison. When punishments meted out to losers are so excessive, it is easy to understand why none of the contesting sides wants to lose an election and each side tries to win at any cost. Therefore, unless we can eliminate the disproportionate differences in the rewards for the winners and the punishments for the losers, we will not be able to create any sense of trust, and ultimately bring civility between the two major political forces in the country. Any dialogue between the government and the opposition on the arrangements for the next parliamentary elections must include a discussion on how to establish a level playing field not only before and during the elections but also after the elections, so that neither side needs to fear dire consequences of a prospective electoral loss. Some observers of Bangladeshi politics have argued that the losing side needs to be given some positive incentives to sit in the opposition. I will not go so far. We have seen how the opposition has continued with the practice of boycotting plenary meetings in successive parliaments, despite enjoying equal salaries and other privileges such as constituency development funds and import of duty free cars. There is no need to give extra incentive to the opposition so that they behave responsibly as a democratic opposition. But the government also needs to act responsibly and recognise that in a democracy the opposition has an important legitimate role to play. It has the primary responsibility of critiquing the government and propagating an alternative. What is really hard to understand is why such a hostile government-opposition relation has continued for more than two decades. After all, both the AL and the BNP have won and lost two elections each since 1991. The incumbent has always lost the elections despite its control of public resources and administration for five years. Since the “winner takes all” style of politics has not yielded any positive electoral outcomes, is it necessary for the two major political forces to pursue their violent confrontations? Is it not high time that they stop worrying about being winners and losers and work out an arrangement where both can coexist on a level playing field so that the citizens can get on with their daily lives?

    "title": "No end to injustice of war on terror",
    "body": "More than four years after Barack Obama pledged to close the US internment camp at Guantanamo, over half its 166 inmates are on hunger strike, 16 are being force fed, and soldiers last week used rubber bullets against “non-compliant” prisoners. Guantanamo, along with Abu Ghraib, long ago became a symbol of the lawless brutality of George Bush’s war on terror. Set up on US-occupied Cuban territory, it was filled with supposed “enemy combatants” seized in post-invasion Afghanistan, the vast majority held without charge or trial, brutalised and tortured. That was all supposed to have come to an end after Obama’s election. But instead of shutting this monstrosity, the camp is being rebuilt. Congress has played a central role in keeping Guantanamo open. But the president only tried to move it to Illinois, not end the scandal of indefinite detention without trial. And he’s personally blocked the release of dozens of prisoners, even when they’ve been cleared. That’s at the heart of why the detainees are striking. Among them is Shaker Aamer, a Saudi-born British resident held without charge for 11 years, much of it in solitary confinement. As with half of the rest of the prisoners, the US authorities now accept that there is no case against him, and he was cleared for release six years ago. Aamer hasn’t seen his family since 2001, and has never met his 11-year-old son, Faris. He has refused food for 71 days, and his case is due to be debated on April 24 in the British parliament in response to a petition of over 100,000 names. But it now turns out that, uniquely among the prisoners, Aamer has been cleared for release to Saudi Arabia. Despite British claims to be lobbying for his return to London, the evidence suggests neither London nor Washington wants anything of the kind. As Aamer’s lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, puts it: “The sole reason to send Shaker to Saudi Arabia is to have him silenced, most likely by sentencing him to a long imprisonment after a sham trial.” The reason is not hard to find. Soon after he was seized, Aamer says he was assaulted and tortured (into falsely confessing links to al-Qaida) by US officials at Bagram air base in Afghanistan in the presence of MI6 (the UK’s secret-intelligence agency) officers - abuse that continued at Guantanamo. Even more dangerously, he was also present, along with British intelligence agents, when Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi was tortured at Bagram into alleging that Saddam Hussein was training al-Qaida terrorists - bogus claims Bush and Colin Powell used to justify the invasion of Iraq. The Metropolitan police (the Greater London police force) has now opened three new investigations into UK intelligence collusion with torture and “rendition”, including Aamer’s case. That’s on top of MI6’s role in the kidnapping of Libyan dissidents and their families in 2004, for which the British government has already paid out over GBP2m in compensation. Earlier this month detectives interviewed Aamer in Guantanamo. No wonder the British government is so keen to force through secret court hearings in “national security” cases through its justice and security bill - or that it has struggled to convince the courts that the Salafist cleric Abu Qatada, regularly detained without charge for years, would not be at risk of torture if packed off to a police state such as Jordan. The scale of torture, kidnapping and detention without trial unleashed by the US government after 9/11 is, as the US Constitution Project report found last week, “indisputable”. And at every stage it’s been backed and emulated by its closest allies. At least 54 states, including Britain and 24 others in Europe, took part in the CIA’s secret “extraordinary rendition” programme, it’s now emerged. And British forces have carried out plenty of beatings and torture in Afghanistan and Iraq, either on their own or in cahoots with US and local forces, as multiple reports and inquiries have now made clear. It’s hardly surprising in the wake of such a saga that western claims to be the champions of human rights and humanitarian intervention are treated with derision across much of the world. But as the west’s dirty secrets are seeping out, the war on terror itself has already mutated. Obama hasn’t closed Guantanamo or held those who authorised these barbarities to account. But US torture camps and boots on the ground are on the way out. Their place has been taken by air and proxy campaigns, such as in Libya and Syria, and drone wars that have already killed thousands in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia - but are more popular at home. We don’t yet know the motivations of the two men accused of carrying out last week’s atrocity in Boston, which killed three people and seriously injured many more. But we do know that 61 were killed the same day in bomb attacks in Iraq that were blamed on al-Qaida, brought to the country by the US-British invasion. And 16 were killed in Pakistan the following day in a suicide attack claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, which mushroomed as a result of the invasion of Afghanistan. What is certain is that so long as the US and its allies intervene, occupy and wage war across the Arab and Muslim world - whether directly or by proxy, with daisy cutters or drones - such outrages will continue. It’s the logic of a war of terror without end. Seamus Milne is Associate Editor, the Guardian.",

    "title": "Of good versus evil",
    "body": "When I was a child, I always believed good triumphed over evil. There was never a question of it being otherwise. That was just the way things were. People who were good came out on top. People who were kind got rewards. People who loved were loved back. These are the unfortunate lessons that my parents taught in every bedtime story they told me when I was young, and in every lecture they sternly gave me when I so much as put a toe out of line. Secretly, I always wondered why all the bad characters in the books that I read, and in the movies that I watched had more power and seemed infallible, but I never allowed myself to question it, because – let’s face it – who in their right mind wants to believe that bad can overpower good? This morning I woke up to the news that a multistorey building in Savar had collapsed and I suddenly thought of good versus evil. I thought about all those garment factory workers trapped in that building trying to get out and I realised something. Good doesn’t exist anymore, at least not in Bangladesh, because good is being killed. Good is dying in garments factory fires in Ashulia, and being murdered in the streets. Good is screaming in that building in Savar, begging for someone to save them. I don’t know whose fault this is, but what I do know is that we are all responsible to a certain extent. About 117 people lost their lives last November in the Ashulia fire. And although we all updated our Facebook statuses, and all felt bad, and all talked about what a shame it was, guess what? We forgot about it. Because here we are just five months shy of that horrific incident and we’re back to square one. Another avoidable tragedy in which the prospect of making money takes precedence over people’s lives, where the voices of the poor fall on deaf ears, where their lives aren’t valued and they are basically collateral damage. Right now the death toll is at 107 and rising. People are still trapped in the building and I cannot help but wonder how many more incidents like this we will have to witness. How many more unnecessary deaths before someone has to pay for it? How much more shame must we feel before the repercussions of these wrongdoings, of these heinous misdeeds, come back to haunt us? But we are not completely lost. All over the country, people are frantically donating blood to help out the victims, and are gathered in front of the building trying to get the trapped garment workers out. So I am wrong. Good does exist in Bangladesh, but I am left with the same question that I had when I was a little girl – how much power does good really have over evil, because from where I am standing, it looks like the people who are wanting to do good are constantly struggling and coming up against barriers, while evil barely breaks out in a sweat. How much power do we, as the mere citizens of this very troubled and lost nation hold? And what can we do to ensure that a tragedy of this nature can never happen again?

    "title": "How many deaths will it take till we know?",
    "body": "We have been here before. It has not been five months since a tragedy in the garment industry had us all wringing our hands and vowing that enough was enough. Then it was a fire that broke out in Ashulia, killing at least 120. Yesterday it was the collapse of a building that housed five garment factories, and the death toll has already reached 80. With hundreds trapped under the rubble the only grim certainty is that it will continue to rise. The most noteworthy common denominator in these two tragedies is not that they happened in garment factories or the fact that the buildings were not up to code (in one case fire safety rules were flouted, in the second official directives, to say nothing of the building code, were contemptuously dismissed). Both of these are sobering enough, and in and of themselves are worthy of condemnation. But the real outrage is the human callousness that underpinned both tragedies, and how easily they might have been averted with but a modicum of humanity and good sense. What is striking is the absence of even basic decency on the part of those who were culpable, and how cheaply they held the lives of those who worked for them or occupied their buildings. There will be time enough to ponder why it is so often garment factories where these tragedies occur, and whether there is something endemic to the industry that makes it vulnerable to these kinds of atrocities and abuse. Sheer coincidence? I don’t think so. With the regularity of these deaths, the industry needs to take a long look at itself, and ask the question why it is in the garment industry that a disproportionate number of tragedies occur. Equally important will be to scrutinise the government’s role in enforcing simple regulations meant for the safety of workers. We already know that decades of incompetence and inaction have led us to a truly sorry state of affairs when it comes to building safety, with many residential buildings being little more than death-traps, to say nothing of the sweat-shops housing thousands of low wage workers. The question is: what has the government been doing about it. The government may try to argue, as it always does, that the problem is too big to solve. But that does not absolve the government from the responsibility for at least trying. This should be on the front burner. It should be a major agenda item for the government, and it is clear that it is not. So the government cannot hide behind the excuse of doing the best that it could under the circumstances. No one is asking for or expecting perfection. But a certain basic level of concern and competence is the very least the public can demand. It is abundantly clear that the government has other priorities (in fairness, so does the opposition) and that building safety, let alone building safety for garment factories, is simply not one of them. But today, even all this pales in comparison, and any outrage we might feel against the garment industry and the government must take second place so that we can focus our outrage on those who are truly deserving of our ire: the owner of the building and the owners of the factories that were housed in it. We cannot let the excuse of collective responsibility or government inaction let them off the hook. Because, just like Tazreen, where the principal cause of death was the human factor, so it was again yesterday. In Tazreen, the fire alarms went off and the workers were streaming out when they were told to go back inside and the gates were locked behind them. If not for the almost unbelievable actions of the factory supervisors, the tragedy might have been averted. Similarly, yesterday, there was plenty of advance warning of the problem. The structural defects had been identified clearly the night before, and Brac Bank, which also had a branch in the building had taken the decision to pull its workers out. Even the garment factories pulled their workers out the night before. But yesterday morning they were ordered back to work, with horrific consequences.This is beyond mere indifference to the safety of workers. This callous disregard, this putting profits ahead of people shows that there is something very wrong inside the parties responsible, and by extension, inside all of us. We live in a country where life is cheap and too may people simply do not value the life of anyone except their own kith and kin. At first, I could not believe that anyone could actually take such a risk with thousands of lives in the balance. But it all makes perfect sense when we realise that for the owners, it wasn’t their lives at stake, it was only the lives of people they evidently think of as expendable and beneath their concern. The actions of both the building owner and the factory owners have shamed all of us Bangladeshis. To hold human life so cheap is the unforgivable sin. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. This was no accident, this was no misfortune. It wasn’t even the product of negligence, simple or gross, or even reckless disregard for human life. This was worse than that. This was murder in the first degree. Zafar Sobhan is Acting Editor, Dhaka Tribune.",

As an official who is meant to represent us, it is mortifying that Muhith chose to take this initiative. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the government has made this kind of a gaffe. A couple of weeks ago, it was reported that the government had approached the Islamic Development Bank, requesting that it resumes its funding of the controversial bridge project. This attitude is a complete turnaround from when the government condescendingly told the World Bank that they were welcome to pull their funding as we had the means to fund the project on our own.It is perplexing that the government seems to believe that it can make these kinds of bold statements and disregard allegations of corruption on the one hand, and then on the other hand, ask the same donor to reallocate those same funds. The ramifications of these actions are more far-reaching than the government seems to fathom. Not only did government leaders allegedly engage in corrupt practices, but when confronted, the government chose not to address the issue. Going back to the World Bank with the aforementioned request signals that the Bangladeshi government just doesn’t get it. The government still apparently has no comprehension of the gravity of a large-scale corruption charge or perhaps it is simply indifferent to how it is perceived by others both inside and outside the country. Neither of which augurs well for the future.",

    "title": "Factory collapse poses new challenge to US GSP",
    "body": "Bangladesh officials have expressed concern over yesterday’s tragic apparel factory collapse in Savar that took place at a time when the country is negotiating with the Generalised System of Preference (GSP) issue to get an advantage in apparel exports to the US market. The eight-storey building collapse left around 145 people dead and more than 1,000 were reported injured until this report was filed yesterday night. The incident would stimulate fresh inquiries from the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) as a pre-condition before awarding Bangladesh the GSP, officials who are dealing with the issue apprehended. “We will definitely have to face a series of fresh USTR questions about the factory’s collapse,” a senior official of commerce ministry said. The ministry yesterday replied to a number of questions from the USTR to qualify for the GSP facilities that is considered to be helpful to avert export fall in the US market. The official said: “The commerce ministry have sent a set of response to USTR’s 19 questions through fax and mail today.” During the fourth round of hearing on GSP in Washington on March 28, the USTR wanted further details on a host of issues from Bangladesh. “The killing case of Labour leader Aminul Islam is now treated as a sensational case and police is now hunting the main accused killer Mustafiz,” the official added. The official said: “The ministry has complied with the USTR on labour standard issues with the government approval of the amended Labour Law.” “We hope that yesterday’s garment factory incident in Savar will not affect the current USTR queries which decides the fate of the country’s US GSP facilities,” commerce secretary Mahbub Ahmed told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday over the phone. He also informed that the commerce ministry will look into the matter after the investigation team submit a report to the concerned authorities of the government. “We will answer the queries of USTR on the Savar garment factory tragedy if they send queries in the near future, he pointed out. He also said: “The ministry would immediately call a meeting on compliance issues of garment factories.” Meanwhile, the foreign ministry also echoed the concerns over the GSP facility issue in the US market. “It is embarrassing that the tragic accident occurred on the day we are submitting our post-hearing submission on GSP to the USTR,” said an official of the foreign ministry. The magnitude of the accident is huge and it might be of a concern for US buyers and the administration, he said. “Foreign diplomats are asking about the incident and we hope to respond to them late at night or tomorrow when we will get a clear picture of the situation,” he added. The safety concern, so far, was limited to fire incidents but now it would be expanded to building code compliance, the official added. The fire safety became a big issue after the fire incident of Tazreen Fashion left 111 people dead last year in December. A commerce ministry official said in the GSP hearing, the USTR mainly expressed fire safety concern and the government addressed it in the post-submission hearing. “We hope to retain the GSP facility this time but the government will have to address the overall safety issue including building code to have a sustainable business prospect,” he said. “Introduction of a ‘hotline’ for fire safety and other measures might satisfy the USTR this time but if the accidents with such magnitude occur every other month, it would be difficult for the government to negotiate with them,” the official added.",

    "title": "Ill-fated factories supplied global brands",
    "body": "The ill-fated factories at the collapsed Rana Plaza complex in Savar were making clothes for leading international brands, it was revealed on Wednesday night. Documents recovered from the wreckage and made available to Dhaka Tribune by labour rights activists showed that Ether 33, Phantom Apparel Ltd and New Wave Apparel which were housed on the third to seventh floors of the building were supplying well-known international labels including British retailer Primark, Italian fashion brand Benetton and Spanish clothing label Mango. The tragedy has once again focused international attention on Western companies' increasing use of factories here to produce low-cost clothes and so-called fast fashion, making Bangladesh the second-largest clothing exporter after China. Labour rights groups say international brands should do more to improve working conditions in Bangladeshi factories. ‘Investigating supply chain’ Primark admitted that it was producing clothes at Rana Plaza while Benetton and Mango said they were investigating whether orders had found their way to the factories in the collapsed building. Canadian retail giant Loblaw Cos. also confirmed that workers at the complex were making clothes for its Joe Fresh clothing line. \"We will be working with our vendor to understand how we may be able to assist them during this time,\" a spokeswoman said. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. which was listed as a customer on the website of one of the building's garment contractors, on Wednesday said it was \"investigating across our global supply chain to see if a factory in this building was currently producing for Wal-Mart.\" Children's Place Retail Stores Inc. confirmed that one of the factories has produced clothing for the company in the past, but said it wasn't currently doing so. The factory owners could not be reached for comment. Foreign companies looking for an alternative to China have flooded into Bangladesh in recent years, as rising pay in China has increased the cost of manufacturing there. In China, some provinces have raised minimum wages to more than $200 a month, while in Bangladesh the government sets the minimum wage for entry level garment workers there at less than $37 (Taka 3,000) a month. In March, Bangladesh's ministry of labor and employment, along with international labor unions and the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, adopted a national action plan on fire safety for the industry. Plans included modernising equipment, increasing the number of fire stations in industrial areas and overhauling fire- and building-safety laws and regulations, inspections and worker training. Wal-Mart, whose products were found at the scene of the Tazreen fire even though it had barred contractors from using the factory, overhauled its global sourcing standards this year, adopting a \"zero-tolerance policy\" for violations. The retailer warned it would immediately sever ties with the companies that subcontract work to factories without Wal-Mart's knowledge starting on March 1, and at some point would publish the names of terminated factories on its website. Critics say the changes don't go far enough. Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a Washington-based nonprofit monitoring group, said labor-rights groups' calls for better safety measures at Bangladesh factories had been met with \"vague promises\" from retailers. Human-rights groups have been calling on apparel brands and retailers to sign on to the Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety Agreement, which would establish a system of independent factory inspectors whose recommendations would be binding. But the program has yet to get off the ground. PVH Corp., owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and German retailer Tchibo have signed up. Foreign clothing companies conduct safety audits of factories they use, and normally avoid those based in mixed-use commercial buildings like Rana Plaza because having multiple tenants raises the possibility of hazards like blocked fire exits. But work is often subcontracted to factories in such buildings and complex supply chains make verification almost impossible.",

    "title": "Political unrest may lead Bangladesh to negative credit rating",
    "body": "Global rating agency Moody’s Thursday apprehended that the prolonged political unrest might lead Bangladesh to earn negative rating, deterring investment and disrupting economic growth. The forecast emerged in the wake of spiraling political standoff and a series of strikes the country facing since February this year. Bangladesh achieved a stable sovereign outlook of Ba3 for the third consecutive year. Analysts say negative rating might put adverse impact over the issuance of sovereign bond by the government by June this year and on getting foreign loan by the private sector. Escalating political tensions in the run-up to parliamentary elections - due between October 2013 and January 2014 - are a deterrent to investment and are disruptive to economic growth, says Moody's Investors Service in its latest report titled \"Credit Analysis: Bangladesh\". It report, however, did not forecast that the political strife would spiral out of control, but said Moody's would view prolonged unrest as credit negative. Pointing fingers at Hall-Mark loan scam, it said Bangladesh's governance weaknesses became more apparent in the past year as seen in the World Bank's withdrawal of funding for the Padma Bridge project in June 2012 and a state-owned Sonali Bank's misappropriation of funds a few months later. The incident involving Sonali Bank highlighted the weak governance structure of state-owned commercial banks and prompted the government to significantly tighten the regulatory framework to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, said Moody’s. Finance adviser to the last caretaker government Mirza Azizul Islam said Moody’s assessment is quite normal under the present situation. “If you look at the state-owned banks and some private banks, which is important element for the financial sector, they have recently been plugged by credit fraudulence and scam. This leads to rise in classified loan and deficit in provisioning of the banks over the last several months,” he said. On the other hand, he added, the real sector is also passing critical moment while imports and investments were continuously declining due to series of strikes, and poor governance in Padma Bridge works has also been seen. “These are the ominous sign for negative rating,” said the economist. If rating is negative, uncertainty might surface in subscription for sovereign bond and the interest rate of the bond might increase, he added. “Another point is that recently we have seen growing trend of external credit by the private sector. Such credit might be costly,” he said. Minister AMA Muhith recently said the government is going to float ‘sovereign bond’ by June this year for various purposes, including the construction of the Padma Bridge with internal resources. The government planned to raise $1bn through issuance of sovereign bond at 5.5% interest rate. Moody’s in its report also said Bangladesh's Ba3 rating and stable outlook reflect Moody's assessment of four factors: its \"low\" economic, institutional and government financial strengths, as well as its \"low\" susceptibility to risks from financial, economic and political events. Macroeconomic stability was regained in 2012 as seen in the shift in the current account back to surplus and the decline in inflation. However, persistent labor disruptions and bank stability pose risks going forward, it said. Importantly, the International Monetary Fund's Extended Credit Facility (ECF) approved in March 2012 is providing a framework for prudent policies, it said. “The government has passed two major pieces of legislation -- the Bank Companies Act, which aims to enhance the mandate of Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank; and a landmark revision to the VAT law.” The rating also incorporates economic, government financial and institutional weaknesses. “A key risk flagged over recent months is the poor financial performance of state-owned commercial banks, primarily due to governance limitations.” However, recent developments have prompted significant tightening of the regulatory framework, and some prudential measures have been taken that could limit contagion effects, according to the report.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) yesterday suspended membership of five readymade garment factories for violating its orders to not operate while housed at Rana Plaza in Savar. It also took initiative to stop all kinds of activities of the five factories, vice president of BGMEA Shahidullah Azim told the media at a press briefing at the BGMEA conference room in the city yesterday. The five factories are - New Wave Bottoms, New Wave Styles, Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tack and EtherTex, all housed in the collapsed building at Savar. The eight-storey commercial building collapsed on Wednesday claiming at least 231 lives and leaving over 1600 injured. Hundreds more were still trapped under the building as rescue work continued on the second day. Vice-president (finance) of BGMEA Riaz Bin Mahmud said they would compensate the families of those who lost their lives in this tragic incident. He added that BGMEA took initiatives to provide proper medication to some 1810 injured. Three teams consisting BGMEA officials have already been working to ease the rehabilitation process of the workers of these factories, adding that if needed, BGMEA would send the critically injured aboard for better treatment. Riaz said that they are in discussion with the government to bury the dead in their respective villages. He also thanked BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia for visiting the spot today and withdrawing their hartal programme on Wednesday. Meanwhile, activists of some social organisations gathered in front of the BGMEA building yesterday demanding capital punishment to the owners of the five garment factories.",

    "title": "Will we continue to be silent?",
    "body": "One girl asked him [the factory manager]: “Mr. Bonstein, why is there no water in the buckets? In case of a fire, there would be nothing with which to fight it.” He became enraged at our group of price committee members, and with inhuman anger replied: “If you’ll burn, there’ll be something to put out the fire.” (Stein, 1977) That same day in March 1911, the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire killed 146 young women in New York City. Much like workers in Bangladeshi garments factories, the young women worked in sub-par conditions that included: being locked-in during working hours, low wages, long hours, and cramped spaces. When the fire broke, they had no escape. Many jumped out the windows and died, choosing not to burn to death. And much like the Bangladeshi garments factory workers, they were among some of the poorest individuals in the country: working class eastern European immigrants. However, unlike Bangladesh, where factory fires like the Triangle fire is commonplace, a host of changes in safety laws occurred in response to the fire; the Triangle fire sparked a movement by labor groups that seized the moment to demand reforms that would change workplace environment in the United States for good. Among such labor groups were the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU), which represented skilled garment workers in the 1900s, and the National Women’s Trade Union League (NWTUL), which was a group of middle and upper class women. The League was instrumental in disseminating questionnaires about workplace safety conditions to factory workers to understand their grievances and then presenting their grievances at a rally in New York City. Their call for help did not fall on deaf ears. Instead, it led to the creation of a Factory Investigating Commission (FIC) that was responsible for assessing workplaces in New York. In addition, the Bureau of Fire Prevention was created, which required stairwells, fire alarms, extinguishers and hoses to be installed in all factories. The following year, eight bills were passed by the legislature that addressed safety issues in the workplace including: sanitation, minimum age of workers and workplace injury. In 1913, the FIC suggested 25 new bills to mandate buildings to have fire escapes, fireproof stairways, as well as regulations that would enable them to inspect all multistoreyed buildings for safety. In 1916, smoking was also outlawed in factories as a fire hazard. In the 1930s, many of these provisions were mandated on the federal level. The Triangle factory fire is reminiscent of the Tazreen Garments factory fire that killed 112 workers in Dhaka several months ago. Amidst locked doors and the absence of fire exits, young women jumped to their deaths or burned to death, as factory supervisors stopped workers from leaving the premises even after fire alarms went off. In response, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) had announced plans to expel 850 factories from its membership due to noncompliance with safety and labor standards. However, there were no changes in legislation that ensured safety for factory workers. There were no Leagues or worker groups that were outraged enough to demand changes in legislation that would enable workers to work in humane conditions. The question of the day is, perhaps, why? The middle and upper class women in the United States battled for poor immigrants a 100 years ago. Their movement sparked the changes that we see today. But why are we silent? Where is our civil swwociety? Why is it that we can only speak on social media about it, why is it that we can write op-eds about it, but we still do not see actual change? Why do we not hold accountable the people who own such businesses? Why do we not hold accountable the engineers and architects and their work ethics when they build such factories without thinking about something as basic as safety? Why is it that we do not hold accountable the lawmakers who should have worked this out a long time ago? Is it because we are somehow related to those in power, and we don’t want to burn bridges (and so we burn factories)? Is it becuase we know those who own these businesses and we want to remain friends with them? Is it because we simply do not care in the long run (in the short run, we care enough to write about it)? Or is it because we know that we really have no say? Is it because we know that we can demand change, but those demands will not be met? Is it because we have no real power to change legislation that would negatively affect the rich? Is it because Bangladesh really belongs to other people – those with political power and those who can buy political power? While rescue efforts by the army and firemen continue with inadequate machinery and the love of the local people who are helping them save people, the death toll keeps rising. So far, 142 have been reported dead and 1600 injured. Reports indicate that there were warning signs, including a crack in the building that caused an evacuation the day before. Workers were apprehensive about returning to work the next day, but were forced to by garments factory owners. The Home Minister has cited faulty construction as the reason for the collapse. But no one has said a word about how such a building could become a factory employing 6000 people. There is yet to be an announcement about setting up a factory inspection commission that would ensure workplace safety for the some of most hard-working members of the labor force in the country. Will we continue to be silent? A version of this article was posted on alalodulal.org.",

    "body": "Yet another tragedy in Savar, where hundreds of garments- workers have died. Yet again, there will be a lot of hype about this, and after a while, everyone will forget this incident after we have to face something even worse. Lots of buildings have collapsed in recent history without much being done about it. Just like the incidents where “launches” in Bangladesh drown after being overloaded with far more passengers than they should normally accommodate - especially during Eid festivals. This incident too, will slowly fade without justice being served to those responsible. The Savar tragedy will be blamed on many people. Engineers will lose their jobs and administrators will be ordered to show-cause upon. Members of political parties will play blame games, and blame each other for the mishap. But the real culprit will, perhaps, never be punished and probably go free without getting the deserved justice. Who exactly is the real culprit anyway? I believe that the practice of rampant corruption in our country is the single most important culprit that is to be blamed. Some people might disagree with this, but I actually believe that corruption kills more people than malaria, terrorists, professional killers or any other people we normally associate with the act of “killing” or “murder.” Thanks to corruption, not as many hospitals are built as we should expect, or are run with poor funds; thanks to corruption, roads and highways are badly made and countless numbers of people lose their lives in traffic accidents; thanks to corruption, quality schools are not made, and young children have to opt for inadequate education, where they are subject to becoming brainwashed to a point where they may become suicidal and kill people in the name of religion. Sadly enough, the list is endless. The question is, will this practice of rampant corruption eventually kill us all? I would like to believe that the life of each poor garments-worker is as valuable as anyone else in the country. I would not like to see my countrymen mourn over this incident, but demand punitive action and exemplary punishment against all those involved and responsible and not rest until their demands are met. If we do not do that soon, these incidents will indeed keep getting repeated forever. Mahdin Mahboob teaches engineering at ULAB.",

We need professionals to correct the flaws in the system that others may miss. It will need the collective efforts of the owners, workers, professionals and aspiring graduates. We must try to steer the best minds of our nation to the industry that brings us the most revenue. If we start now we may not have to put souls on sale for Tk20,000.

    "title": "It means nothing to be Bangladeshi",
    "body": "The past few months, we’ve seen a resurgent and emphatic affirmation of our identity. We’ve seen chest-beating nationalism, vigorous flag waving, and passionate, positive posturing about what it means to be Bangladeshi. We’ve made our secular values heard, our demands for justice known. We’ve even asserted our right to be ultra-religious if we want to be. The truth is, it seems to mean very little to be Bangladeshi. For a country so obsessed with our sense of self-worth, we seem to have completely forgotten why we became one in the first place. Contrary to popular belief, we didn’t become Bangladesh so that we could all sing and dance in Bangla and revel in our own culture, pleasant as that might be. That wasn’t the reason at all. Anyone who knows a little bit of history knows that Bangladesh exists because we were tired of being exploited. 43 years later, the exploitation has not stopped, not for the tens of millions of people who form the backbone of our economy and indeed of our state. Every day of those 43 years, an overwhelming majority of Bangladeshis have been working for a pittance, with no rights, no standards of care and no recourse to justice. All of this we have seen and ignored. In our rush to establish ourselves, we put off doing perhaps the most important thing a country should do – ensure that its citizens are looked after. But it doesn’t end there either. The absence of efficient mechanisms or institutions that create the conditions required to look after people, has left all sorts of avenues open for unscrupulous, irresponsible operators to exploit. Often the willingness to enforce regulations that do exist, or for that matter, to build better institutions remains conspicuously absent since the people who might have done that, benefit most from a system full of holes. All of this too, is known, and often ignored. But what happened in Savar, on the back of a series of similar tragedies can’t be ignored any longer. We can no longer call ourselves a country or even a nation, if the people belonging to it are allowed to die such horrible, senseless deaths simply because we couldn’t stop a faulty system from falling, literally, on top of them. In any case, we may have already forfeited our right to call ourselves civilised when we allowed a dysfunctional status quo to prevail in the name of profit; but when people are forced into factories or locked inside them and killed, we aren’t far from losing the right to call ourselves human as well. But we have squandered, repeatedly, every opportunity to come clean. Instead we seem to only continue along a downward spiral that makes the figures of pilfered, looted and siphoned-off public funds rise exponentially while governance practices becomes more and more convoluted, and our economy becomes increasingly exploitative. Given all that, the rhetoric of a “Shonar Bangla” means nothing at all if basic standards can’t be ensured for the people we rely on to build it for us. Our flag will mean nothing, and our liberation will mean even less if we don’t stop turning our backs on the priorities that led to the birth of this country to begin with. Bengali culture itself, if that is indeed what we are seeking to preserve, will die a dishonourable death if we keep ignoring the fact that a culture is not just a language or a mode of expression but a complete system of values. Values that we have, so far, failed miserably to uphold. Zeeshan Khan is a Senior Sub-editor, Dhaka Tribune",

He will assume office as ADB’s ninth president on April 28. He succeeds Haruhiko Kuroda, who resigned in March. Nakao will finish the unexpired term of his predecessor, which ends in November 2016. “The ADB board of governors looks forward to working with Mr Takehiko Nakao and his strong leadership of the institution,” said P Chidambaram, chair of the ADB board of governors and the finance minister of India. “His extensive experience in international finance and development, and broad and deep knowledge of the Asian region, will serve ADB well in pursuing its vision of an Asia-Pacific region free of poverty,” Chidambaram added. In a career spanning more than three decades, Takehiko Nakao has held senior positions in the Japanese ministry of finance, with extensive experience in international finance and development. He also served as visiting professor at the University of Tokyo in 2010 and 2011, teaching international finance. Born in 1956, Nakao holds a BA in economics from the University of Tokyo and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members, 48 of whom are from the region. In 2012, ADB assistance totalled $21.6bn, including co-financing of $8.3bn.",

    "title": "Do your job, protect our workers",
    "body": "The tragedy in Savar should remind us all about how poorly employees are treated in Bangladesh, and how the government should step up efforts to ensure a safe working environment for the people it claims to represent. While the owners of the factories should certainly be held responsible for continuing to use a building that is structurally unsafe, even to the untrained eye, the fact that there is no proper enforcement from government agencies that are supposed to ensure that work areas are safe is even more worrisome. Government regulations about these matters do exist, but are often disregarded. The government has long been aware that the relevant authorities do not have the adequate resources to enforce their directives. While the Tazreen fire indicated that the government must be more vigilant with regard to regular factory inspections, this more recent tragedy in Savar highlights that the steps taken post-Tazreen have not gone nearly far enough. The authorities previously told the owners that they needed to shut down until Buet engineers could inspect the building. Of course, the onus lies with the owners, but the fact remains that the authorities either could not or did not forcefully shut the premises down; an act that would have prevented the loss of life that the nation experienced yesterday. The authorities clearly need to have access to the resources required to be able to fulfil their mandate. A system where employers can disregard the authorities and put lives at risk obviously does not work. After Tazreen, the government had plenty of time to make the necessary changes to how these issues are dealt with. It should have found ways to ensure that structures are built to code; it should have taken legal action against those responsible for allowing these tragedies to occur; ultimately, it should have ensured that preventable industrial tragedies are, in fact, prevented. Instead, it was busy pursuing its own self-serving agenda without regard to the consequences. It is high time that the government steps up and actually performs its responsibilities; the people of the nation deserve that much. The government's inaction and indifference should no longer be tolerated.",

    "title": "The ugliness behind Savar",
    "body": "Despite knowing by Tuesday that Rana Plaza in Savar was unsafe, and even with cracks being visible to all that day, the owners of the building and the four garments factories housed in it defied all cautionary words to keep their businesses running the next day to a catastrophic end. What boggles the mind is that the owners knew. They were given ample forewarning beforehand. The engineers had ordered an evacuation of the building on Tuesday when the cracks appeared, a glaring sign of the building’s imminent collapse. The building was closed down and evacuated. Workers were sent home. Brac Bank, who had a branch office there, had pulled its employees out of harm’s way. That in itself should have signaled to the building owners and to the garment factory owners that they ought to fully comply as well, and keep the building closed. Instead, all admonitions fell on deaf ears. The building was reopened the next morning, and a number of garment workers were compelled to return to work, though they were hesitant to do so. It is bad enough that there are insufficient safety measures in place, bad enough that buildings are not built to code, and many are in danger of collapse, but the key issue in the Savar tragedy is that the owners were aware, but did nothing about it in pursuit of their own ends. This is the last level of human callousness. One cannot ignore the numbers. Of those who have been rescued, over 800 are injured and the dead bodies of at least 92 have been recovered. That number will undoubtedly rise, as thousands are still trapped in the rubble. To purposefully flout a warning when a loss of life can be prevented is unforgiveable. To allow such a tremendous loss of life to take place is little short of murder.",

    "body": "The tragedy in Savar once again showed us how removed the political parties are from the challenges that the country faces. In a time when scores of people from all over the city, and country for that matter, came together to support rescue efforts, our political leaders, from both the ruling and opposition parties, chose to play their political games, and push forward with their regular schedules – regardless of how inappropriate it may be in the face of this national tragedy. As the death count continues to rack up, and people lose hope of ever finding their loved ones, it is disappointing to see that the government seems so aloof in its handling of the situation. It is incomprehensible that our prime minister did not seem to find the magnitude of the tragedy sufficient to warrant a visit. Instead, the government pushed on with the swearing-in ceremony for the president, with all its pomp and grandeur. The prime minister also found the time to inaugurate a new train line that will run between Dhaka and Narayanganj. But credit must be given where it is due. The prime minister did take the time out of her busy schedule to make a couple of underwhelming statements reacting to the tragedy, laced with digs at the opposition party. Apparently, it is possible to find common ground between the ruling and opposition parties. We certainly found some yesterday in their callous attitudes towards Savar. While the BNP did withdraw their hartal in Dhaka, they took seven hours to do it. And, of course, the statements made by BNP leaders were all aimed at making the government look worse. Our “leadership” would do well to take a page out of the public’s book and forget politics for a second. Instead, they should be focused on properly organising rescue efforts that have been inadequate and taking steps to ensure that this kind of tragedy cannot occur again.",

    "title": "Shahbagh: Three months later",
    "body": "Three months into the Shahbagh movement, we are in somewhat better position to perhaps ask - why all the fuss. The late night political commentators and non resident bloggers are out in full force analysing the strategic blunders committed by its leaders. I will leave it to them to write the premature obituaries. But let me ask if it was all worth it. Much has been said about it’s tangible achievements - stopping a potential electoral year compromise, providing much needed public support for the movement and changing the law around the appeal process of the verdict. However, it is the intangible achievements that got little attention from the armchair analysts. For two weeks, the nation was transfixed, focusing on a mass uprising trying to give sense to an inexplicable phenomenon. What made throngs of people go there during those heady days of February? Who are these people? Why were they doing this? Anthropologists will have a field day researching these in the coming weeks and months. But if my anecdotal interviews are any evidence, Shahbag has already done a lot more for generations than we are giving credit for. During the heady days of February, one of my co-workers who spent most of his life mobilising for Udichi told me, “It seems like years of my work have not gone in vain. I go there every day and just sit there, sing and chant slogans.” Another junior university graduate who fixes my computer explained his daily ritual. He got out of work, went straight to Shahbagh and stayed the entire night before going home to have breakfast and head back to work. He continued that for two weeks. I asked him why all this trouble. “My father and his four brothers are freedom fighters. I heard their stories growing up and I can’t be anywhere else,” he said. For an entire generation who were not part of the democracy movement in the 90s, this was the first big cause which was larger than their own selves and they loved being part of this bigger story. There are many, many individual stories like these that have emerged which highlighted that Shahbagh worked as catharsis for a lot of people looking for closure. And what about those who couldn’t go to Shahbagh? Some arranged local gatherings and most were transfixed by the television. This was the first major event that was transmitted live on 24 hour news channels. Let’s not underestimate that power. The ratings of those channels went through the roof as almost every one was talking about Kader Mollah, Rajakars, 1971 and our role during that period. The five year old asked her parents who Kader Mollah was and what was all the fuss about. The parents then told them the story of 1971. An entire new generation was taught through oral history about our proud heritage and the fighting history of saying no to injustice. For the first time ever all of these were done from a platform which was not related to Awami League or BNP. After 40 years, the shaky narrative of 1971 was firmly established through popular discourse beyond partisan politics. So in essence, Shahbagh worked, dare I say it, as a national therapy session for a lot of us. It made sense and people felt vindicated. It made talking about politics relevant for young people. Shahbagh played the role of a natural story teller for an entire new generation who learnt to be proud about a past which they thought only had partisan colours. Instead of partisan colours, they decorated Shahbagh with such beauty and vigour that that in itself became another story - Shahbagh and the artistic and poetic expression around the movement. Was it an urban, middle-class phenomenon? Perhaps. But starting from the 90s movement going back all the way to the mass uprising of 69, which one didn’t start in the urban space? So three months down the road another question that is now being asked repeatedly: Can Shahbagh’s magic be recreated? It will be very hard to recreate Shahbagh again with that same level of intensity. The innocence is now gone and mired with political cajoling and the strategic blunder of not stopping when it was due, the unanimity of Shahbag is perhaps now gone. But let’s not make any mistake. Shahbagh has done more than its fair share. Those of us who projected our years of unfulfilled wishful thinking at Shahbagh are perhaps disappointed that it couldn’t be bigger than it was. I say that’s not Shahbagh’s problem, but yours. Shahbag was just proof of concept; it never wanted to be an alternative political force. It demonstrated a good preview of what’s possible in the future. It has given us hope that in this age of materialism, people are still willing to stick their necks out and stand up to be counted. The pride, the joy that we saw among the younger generation at Shahbagh is something that is rarely visible in this country and there is a lot to be said about that. So Shahbagh may not be recreated again but it has laid the ground of a much more organised political movement around real issues. As our citizens’ news consumption habit changes rapidly (there are more Facebook subscribers than newspaper subscribers in the country now), the level of political awareness is unprecedented. Contrary to popular belief, change will not happen in social media but it may happen through powerful combination of online mobilisation with a strong offline presence. The arrest of the bloggers for short term political expediency is a crude reminder that there is no alternative to organised mobilisations outside the clutches of the parties. In that context, Shahbagh should be a tectonic shift in our political landscape. Even though, in public, a mass disowning of Shahbagh is happening now, but in the private sphere, political parties ignore this voice to its peril. The slogans of Lucky, presence of hundreds and thousands of women in a peaceful movement, powerful visuals of thousands of candles, songs of freedom have left a lasting impression for an entire generation. No matter how much counter narrative is pushed to discredit its leaders and the Shahbagh movement itself, it is a piece of history and memory that a lot of us will carry for the rest of our lives. If you ask me, it is a pretty tall order for a bunch of young kids who started blogging in Bangla as an afterthought. More importantly, it is so much more than what years of talk shops, round tables and scripted media presence have ever achieved in this country. Asif Saleh is a development practitioner.",

    "title": "Have they ever had any reason to care?",
    "body": "The building collapse at Savar, and the following why and how of the incident in the various media, only raised one question in my mind. Why should a person like Sohel Rana bother with building regulations, quality of materials used and such? He is a Jubo League leader in the area and that title exempts him from certain laws and regulations. At this point, people might object to my line of thought, saying that laws of a nation apply to everyone. But in reality they do not. How many times have we, in personal interactions with our peers, said that a particular person cannot be held responsible because he is well connected? Whether we admit it or not, the truth is we have accepted the fact that laws are not equal for everyone. Where is the proof in that statement, you say? I ask you in response, how many of the buildings that we live or work in have followed the related building codes to the letter? We break traffic laws everyday without even thinking about it. We do not care if our actions cause inconvenience to others; at least not at the moment when we are breaking the law. These are only two simple examples of how we, the not-so-well-connected civillians without any political backing, disregard the law everyday. Just for convenience’s sake we forsake rules and regulations all the time, and often, just because we can. Starting from 2005, there have been 10 major incidents of building collapse, most of which resulted in loss of many lives. The collapse of Rana Plaza resulted in the death of at least 200 people and over 1,000 injured – by far the worst in terms of loss of lives. Now let us get back to Sohel Rana. He is a Jubo League leader, which is the youth unit of the Awami League – the party in power. The Jubo League, which in public opinion is currently the most uncontrollable youth wing of any political party, has managed to remain as headstrong as ever. Is it not obvious then, that a leader of such a political wing would give his own wishes priority, if the price were some measly rules, and consequently the loss of hundreds of lives? Why should we even expect people like him to think of others’ well being? When this is the apparent mindset of everyone who has influence or power over the government and its administration, this Savar incident should not shock us. Once we factor in all our intellect and “morality,” we should just be ashamed. Towsif Osman is Editorial Coordinator, Dhaka Tribune.",

    "title": "Kurosawa: A solution to workers' problems",
    "body": "It happened again. Due to the negligence of factory owners, more than 100 people died. And we are asking, how many more times! Didn’t we say last time that it will happen again and again until the government protects the workers? Yes, that is how we think, probably all the people, who are neither the ruthless owners nor their government patrons. We think that the solution is simple. Then why is it that things are not getting fixed? It is because we are looking at the wrong solution. We think that it is the government who can protect the workers. They should make regulations and enact them, and everyone will start to live happily ever after. But, regulations already exist. Now, how do you make government officials really enact them? There is no magic which will make that happen. The government is actually stopping us from arriving at a solution, and consequently it is making the problem worse. Look at every case of such factory incidents. It was both the involvement and the negligence of the government that helped owners to continue killing workers, despite the presence of an immense amount of regulations. It does not matter which party is in power. There is no “good” or “honest” party on earth. That is a myth. Now the burning question is, whether you would seek the help of a group that actually perpetuates the problem. Is it going to work? Let us instead try to see how this problem would have been solved in a free society, devoid of government. There would be no guarantee that mishaps would never happen in a free society, that is how life is. But, in such a society, no one could stop the workers from forming their own police force. Yes, I am talking about the coexistence of multiple police forces. It would be like Kurosawa’s film “Seven Samurai,” where poor village people hire samurais to protect them from bandits. The difference is, we have millions of workers. So even a small premium from each should be enough to make a powerful police force. The cost would be much less than what the workers currently pay for their rent. The police force hired by workers would try to ensure the safety of the workers through persuasion and other peaceful means. But when mishaps happen due to the negligence of the owner, this force would also try to bring them to justice. They would try to incarcerate the owner and collect a large amount in fines. This would soon make the owners realise that the workers are not helpless. The protector of the workers are not the owner’s friend either, as is always the case in a government system. The problem will not sustain for long, or at least would not get worse, as is happening now. And yes, there can be multiple police forces working for the workers. This would create competition and would further lower the premium for workers. The workers will have a choice to move to another security provider, if their current provider’s service is considered unsatisfactory. Why is this solution not possible now? It is because the government assumes a monopoly on the business of security and stops anyone else who would try to build a police force for their own protection. If only one police force exists, it would inevitably and exclusively serve the purpose of the rich owners and their political collaborators. If there are many, it is difficult, or maybe even inpossible, to buy them all. Unfortunately, we are believers, who believe that the perpetuator of the problem, the government, can solve the problem, probably through a massive change of “consciousness toward goodwill.” So, we will go to the monkey again for solutions, and the monkey will eat a little bit more of our cake. That summarises the history of governments. A version of this article was posted on alalodulal.org.",

    "title": "Justice for all",
    "body": "In the wake of the tragic events at Savar on April 24 one wonders if the legal framework of our State is really equipped to protect the lives of all its citizens. The Constitution of Bangladesh in article 32 guarantees, as a fundamental right, the right to life. Numerous laws on labour safety aim to prevent such mindless death. Following a tragic event such as the Savar tragedy, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court customarily issues a rule calling upon the authorities concerned to show cause as to why they should not be directed to take necessary action, as required by law, to effectively investigate, prosecute, and punish those responsible for the deaths and injuries of the victims. Pending hearing of the rule, the Court generally directs the concerned authorities to submit an investigation report regarding the cause of the accident and the safety measures adopted. The court may also direct the authorities to submit a report on the amount paid to the victims as compensation. The court may even issue a direction to ensure medical treatment of the victims and further order the formation of a national committee to monitor compliance by garments factories with the applicable laws on safety. The same is likely to be done this time around. All these laws and directions from the courts are sadly of no use to the next set of victims. Despite the law, it has been our experience that the State repeatedly fails to ensure the most basic of rights, the right to life, to some of its most productive citizens. The problem does not lie with the law but its enforcement and, more fundamentally, with our mindset. If you are a Bangladeshi reading this article, then chances are you belong to a very privileged class of people. You have either personally benefitted from or, like me, have friends and relatives who have benefitted from the growth of the ready made garments (RMG) sector in Bangladesh. We are all guilty of treating workers as dispensable and replaceable factors of production to be exploited by the factory owners to maximize profits. It is us who should be blamed for letting this happen over and over again. We glorify the RMG factory owners as visionary entrepreneurs, offer them Commercially Important Person (CIP) statuses, and bestow upon them annual awards for being the highest foreign exchange earners. If you look deeper, the RMG factory owners are neither great innovators nor great humanitarians. In reality it is the availability of cheap labour that helps them earn foreign currency. It is not their unique entrepreneurial skills that have led to the growth of the RMG sector. Yet we hold them in such high esteem and give them so much clout. Did the BGMEA not build its headquarters in the heart of the capital on illegally occupied wetlands in clear violation of the law? How many of the RMG factory owners have been penalized for the deaths in their factories? Have we not turned a blind eye and refused to hold them accountable? Have we not provided them with undue protection and impunity? We need a change in perspective. It is the factory workers who need to be protected, if not valued and rewarded. We need to realize that there is something wrong with a system that provides buyers in the developed countries with T-shirts for $5 (about Tk400) while the RMG suppliers, being more than adequately compensated for their work, drive around the city with cars that are worth over Tk15,000,000 ($187,500) each – the latest estimate of the BMW 5 series cars seen on the streets of Dhaka. This is happening while the factory workers are paid only about Tk4,000 ($50) per month; that too after the Government forcefully raising the minimum wage of the workers in the face of strong opposition from RMG factory owners. Obviously for the math to add up someone is being exploited in the process. While not trying to undermine success and the pursuit of profit by entrepreneurs, the time has come to set up a legal framework which actually penalises exploitation of workers to the extent that even their lives are seen as collateral damage. Garments owners need to be held accountable and exemplary punishments need to be provided. Unless we hold these people responsible for their negligence and discharge our responsibility of ensuring the right to life for all citizens of the State, including the workers, justice can never be attained.

While we have seen some of our political leaders handle the situation poorly, we have seen an overwhelming response from the public in stepping up and taking things into their own hands. The site of the tragedy has become absolutely inundated with volunteers. People have come forth in droves and are getting their hands dirty. Men and women are risking their health and often their lives in order to help others in need. They have been there day and night, working in dire conditions, surrounded by darkness and misery, steeling themselves against the cries of the injured and dying – and pushing on. Doing what needs to be done so as to help their fellow man. Multiple organisations, groups and individuals have organised collection drives, calling on the masses to donate money, medical supplies, flashlights and any number of items that may assist rescue efforts. These parties have taken efforts to ensure that those working at the site are given the resources they need to continue extraction efforts. Many of the cities hospitals are working non-stop to provide medical assistance to survivors of the tragedy. At some teaching hospitals we have seen a cancellation of scheduled classes so that students can help attend to those injured at Savar. We have also seen doctors from all over the city flock to hospitals surrounding the Savar area to volunteer their services. Even social media has had a role to play in all the efforts to support the rescue. It is important to note that people all over the city, and the country, are coming together to contribute to something bigger than themselves. They are speaking out against injustice, and have proven their dedication to change through organisation and subsequent action. We must hope that following the rescue operation, this same united spirit can be harnessed to bring about the changes that the country desperately needs.",

    "body": "While we do not condone violence, under any circumstance, however, we do understand the reasons behind the RMG workers taking to the streets and vandalising vehicles to protest the gross injustices done to them. Bear in mind, this is a large group of incredibly powerless people who have been pushed beyond their limits. This is a marginalised group of RMG workers who strongly feel they are left with no choice but to protest, and their anger is palpable. Consider the Tazreen Fashion factory fire in November last year, when RMG workers were prevented from leaving and ordered to keep working, while a fire raged through the building, trapping them within. For that matter, consider Savar’s Rana Plaza collapse, where RMG workers were threatened with the loss of their jobs if they did not return to work the next day, even if the building was about to collapse. These workers are expected to be at the beck and call of the garments factory owners, and to give their blood, sweat, tears, and even lives for a few measly takas. They are expected to labour under horrendous conditions in buildings that are arguably death traps. Yet, rather than be recognised for their work, and seen as human beings, their lives are mere playthings to the factory owners. In looking at the larger picture, though their methods may be seen as questionable, their motives are undoubtedly pure. These people have been used and abused, and will no longer take the abuse lying down.",

    "title": "Social responsibility in business: A crash course",
    "body": "The phrase “social responsibility in business” is a yawner for most of us butch entrepreneurs. It seems to be a concept that is currently in vogue among the chatterati who are invariably found solving all of the world’s problems in soigné enclaves of exorbitant five-star hotels. It’s a useless notion that has no relevance in the business world. At its heart, social responsibility in business entails a somewhat common sense notion, viz: “Dead workers are bad for business.” This is especially true if workers die en masse by being roasted alive, crushed in a stampede, jumping out of windows, pulverised under the weight of a flimsily constructed 8-storey buildings, etc. In management consultancy argot: “Precipitous extinction of a key factor of production has catastrophic implications for the longevity of business.” Jests aside, essentially, social responsibility is not just an end by itself; it is also a means for securing a profitable existence for businesses in the long-run. Crudely put, just as well-maintained machines are good for business, the same goes for keeping workers happy and healthy. There are all too many examples in Bangladesh of social responsibility being trampled for the pursuit of short-term profits. While the owners may have escaped punishment for culpable homicide, look at what has happened to their businesses! The word “kaput” comes to mind. Of course, the standard retort to the charge of unsafe working practices is that profit margins are just too low to improve working conditions. Yeah, right! Anybody with even a cursory understanding of financial accounting knows that argument to be complete hogwash. Typically, buildings are depreciated over a 40-year period. So, for every extra Tk10m that is spent to make a building safe, the expense charge is only Tk250,000 per year. So, if a business generating several million dollars in revenue has trouble affording such low amounts for better construction materials, sufficient fire exits, then there is something fundamentally amiss with their business model. But, says the astute entrepreneur who has just returned from a crash-course called “Finance for Non-Accountants,” from a foreign university, “It’s not the profits, we simply do not have enough cash to build a safe working environment.” Well, really! So, then business viability is achieved by exposing workers to life-threatening environments? Who made you God? Finally, there is the “Blame it on Walmart” argument. Of course, buyers must carry out due diligence about their suppliers, but, that in no way absolves the supplier from criminal negligence and irresponsibility. In the 1980s, when loan-default was ubiquitous, a similarly contorted argument, viz: “Blame it on the bank,” was used by the entrepreneurs.After all, if the bank approved a project proposal then it must be their fault if the new business tanked. The workers of Bangladesh have made many of us entrepreneurs wealthy beyond our wildest imagination. Their back-breaking efforts have earned the country enough foreign exchange to allow us to go on credit-card spending sprees abroad. They are not just a factor of production but the life-blood of industry. So, if you find all these arguments unconvincing, just remember this: “Dead workers are bad for business.” Kaiser Kabir is CEO, Renata Limited.",

    "title": "CAF wants Ottawa to work with Dhaka on RMG",
    "body": "A Canadian apparel federation executive has suggested Ottawa to work closely with Dhaka on the enforcement of building code in Bangladesh in exchange for preferential access to the Canadian market. Bob Kirke, executive director of the Canadian Apparel Federation, made the recommendation in the wake of Savar factory collapse that left around 350 killed and 100s injured. “Ottawa could work more closely with the government of Bangladesh and groups such as the International Labour Organisation to improve labour standards and the enforcement of building codes – in exchange for preferential access to the Canadian market,” Kirke said. Indeed, he said, the recent federal budget extends the no-tariff provisions for Bangladesh and other needy countries another 10 years, Canadian newspaper, The Globe and Mail, reported yesterday. “This is part of a government policy to reinforce production in the least-developed countries,” Kirke said. “Can we, on the margins, do something to improve the situation?” When countries such as Canada ditched import duties and quotas on garments from Bangladesh a decade ago, the country became the go-to apparel producer. In 2003, Ottawa dropped its 18% duty on clothing made in Bangladesh, as well as restrictions on volumes shipped here. “It opened up the floodgates,” said Bob Kirke, executive director of the Canadian Apparel Federation. The number of employees in the ready-made garment industry more than doubled in a decade, to four million in 2011-2012 from almost two million in 2000-2001. Clothing producers and retailers rushed to find suppliers in Bangladesh, cashing in on the federal government’s bid to help the country and other least-developed nations to the detriment of Canadian clothing makers, many of which have since closed. Bangladesh boasts a cheap, unskilled work force while China has developed skilled garment workers who are demanding more money – and driving Western retailers to source their clothing increasingly in Bangladesh. But its factories stick to producing the basics – T-shirts and underwear – which generate thin profit margins, putting pressure on the businesses to keep costs down. Retailers such as grocer Loblaw Cos, which makes some of its Joe Fresh apparel in Bangladesh, are drawn to the country for its low cost and large pools of cheap labour. Bangladesh has comprehensive safety regulations but they aren’t well enforced, with few resources and inadequate numbers of inspectors, who are not well paid and can be easily swayed by factory owners, said Avedis Seferian, chief executive officer of WRAP, a non-profit organisation that inspects and certifies factories in Bangladesh and elsewhere (although not connected to Loblaw). Bangladesh is a poor country, and the garment and textile factories make up more than three-quarters of its gross domestic product, Seferian said. While some factories are in poor shape, “it really comes down to how enlightened management is.” “They don’t make as much on a pack of underwear as you do on a designer suit,” he said. “So you end up creating that much more pressure to produce large quantities and get them out as quickly as you can. So the conditions are, unfortunately, very conducive to trying to get things done as cheaply as possible. Therefore the incentive to cut corners where one can is heavy.”",

    "title": "Engage-Not boycott",
    "body": "I’ve been reading of calls in the Canadian and US media for a boycott of Bangladeshi products until there are safe working conditions in Bangladeshi factories. It sounds good. Avoid buying Bangladeshi clothes until the evil owners fix the problems. Sounds easy to do too. Just check the labels and make sure they’re from China or Honduras. Until there’s a fire or building collapse there. The thing about a boycott like that is that it would be counterproductive. There are thousands of garment factories in Bangladesh employing over 4m women. That’s more women than the entire province of Ontario. A boycott or ban would put their livelihoods at risk. Moreover, it doesn’t punish the perpetrators of the crime. And they have no motivation left to even try to improve the working conditions. Is there another way? Buyers, especially big ones like Loblaws (owner of the Joe Fresh brand) and Wal-mart, have a tremendous amount of influence in Bangladesh. And they also have choices. They can chose to engage only firms with good labour practices. They can choose to have inspectors check on those requirements. They can choose to ban sub-contractors unless they comply with the same guidelines. They can cancel orders from any contractors who fail to enforce standards at their subcontractors. They can engage the BGMEA directly and force them to support a set of standards. They can choose to go directly to manufacturers and not work through a series of subcontractors and sub-sub-contractors. Bangladesh does not need aid. Aid money is essentially robbed and sent back to offshore banks leaving the poor taxpayers holding the bag. But it does need trade; at least some of that money gets distributed through all layers of society. Should that trade vanish, all the aid in the world would not be able to lift Bangladesh out of poverty. But is it all a matter of buyer responsibility? Should we not fix our own house before being told to do so? As Bangladeshis, we have come to expect the least of our governments. We don’t expect our government to enforce laws or punish wrongdoers. We don’t expect our government to look out for the poor. Garments workers and expatriate labourers can testify to the fact that we don’t have the minimum services one would expect the government to provide for its largest foreign exchange earners. One hopes that this disaster will spur this government to change that trend. One hopes but doesn’t expect. What about the citizenry? Anything they can do? From the protests and riots on the streets one can be forgiven for thinking that transportation is public enemy number one. For all that angers us Bangladeshis, it’s always vehicles that bear the brunt. We like to burn them, smash them, topple them over and, by the time we’re through, the destruction is an end unto itself and many of the participants forget what the protest was about. It’s also time for our citizens to direct the anger where it is due. Demand better working conditions. Demand enforcement of labour laws. Demand punishment for criminals. Most importantly we need to end our blind support of our political parties. When a minister says the opposition party activists shook the building so it weakened, we need make it clear that his intelligence does not qualify him to be a minister. When the prime minister claims that the owner of the building is not a member of her party, despite his presence in numerous party events, call it what it is, a blatant lie. The media needs to call out politicians on their absurdities and lies. But, for now, there are immediate needs that need to be addressed as well. Strikes and violence are not going to put food on the tables of those who lost their livelihoods to injury. It’s not going to restore anyone’s loved ones, and it is not going to satisfy one’s sense of vengeance. Living half a world away, I have been impressed at the way common people have come together in the rescue effort. We need to remain together for a rehabilitation effort as well. Once the rubble is cleared from the ground and the dead buried, let us not forget the living.",

The owner of the building is surely to blame, for having a huge structure built cheaply. But the bigger question is WHICH company built this? How do building companies get the approval of going ahead with construction without having proper quality checks? HOW do these companies even get their license? Why do WE time and time again vote for a government that does NOTHING to ensure the safety of the people of the nation they swear to protect and nurture? What's even sadder is our government has made absolutely no investment in purchasing rescue gears/transport or any of that sort. That tells me very clearly that the government NEVER ever thought of the safety of the people even once. So what are they doing with the tax money? Buying homes all over the world, expensive cars, and raising crass children. Fank you GOB, Fank you very much! “We live in a country where life is cheap and too many people simply do not value the life of anyone except their own kith and kin.” I have to take this statement one step further by saying that, from what I’ve seen, people here do not even value their own lives, let alone that of their kith and kin! Nobody is more protective than a mother of her newborn. Yet, in Bangladesh, I’ve come in contact with many mothers who toss their babies around and could care less what happens to them. These same women do not think twice about taking abortion pills to kill their fetuses. My own housemaid almost died taking such pills after it was made clear to her the risks associated with the medicine. She openly acknowledges that she would not hesitate to take them again if necessary. I’ve met countless reckless drivers who put their own and others’ lives in danger. When asked why they do so, they proudly boast that they “gamble” with their lives. I’ve questioned innumerable pedestrians as to why they cross roads recklessly when there is a safer alternative, and they simply reply that they’d rather take the risk of crossing a busy road than go to the trouble of using an overpass. Is this widespread reckless behavior really due to lack of education, or is devaluating life ingrained in Bangladeshi culture? The recent tragedy of the garment workers was definitely not an accident, and no one involved in the construction or control of the building can sign it off as one. The people responsible for the death and suffering of these civilians must answer for their crimes, but the question remains: why did the garment workers enter a building that was clearly falling apart? If their employers belittle their value, must they do the same? If Bangladeshis do not value their own lives, then who will?",

Over and over, we have seen the government make the wrong call with regards to how they should move forward with rescue operations. It is extremely disappointing to see how our leaders can be so callous and so very misinformed. Our home minister stated that the rescue operations would only continue until Friday morning with the subsequent focus being on demolition. His statement was met with public outrage – and rightly so. The uninformed comment coming from the home minister was a clear indication of how our leadership was completely uninformed about the actual situation on the ground. It also exhibits the insensitivity that seems to be a staple of the government's response to the tragedy. Luckily, the reaction from the people of the country stayed the demolition operation. As a result, the efforts have seen well over 100 people rescued since Friday morning. Another aspect in which the government essentially failed the nation was in declining foreign assistance for the rescue operation. While the efforts of those on the ground have been commendable, they are short-handed with regard to skilled rescue personnel and necessary equipment, and have been quite vocal about it. The government, as a whole, needs to start reassessing how it is dealing with the situation, and do whatever is in their power to help those in Savar. It is unacceptable that the government did not accept the offer of international assistance that may have been invaluable to rescue efforts, and it is also unacceptable that any member of the government would imply that we would move into demolition activities before we were absolutely sure that all the survivors of the accident had been rescued.",

    "title": "Continuing to hope for unrealistic expectations",
    "body": "Mark Twain wrote “In religion and politics, people’s beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second hand, and without examination.” It fits the situation we are facing in Bangladesh perfectly. Rights and freedoms are under attack across the board, with impunity. While civil society and activists fight to regain ground lost, a far more insidious and difficult challenge faces Bangladesh. We must ensure that no single group or individual can impose their personal beliefs and/or religious affiliations, at the expense of any one or any religion, on us as a nation. For too long we have struggled with this crucial subject, allowing politicians to appease ultra extremists, for fear of being labelled “Anti-Islamic” or worse, atheists. At the same time, religious leaders continue to dabble in politics, playing on people’s fears and insecurities to keep them in line, for their own benefit. The original Constitution of Bangladesh enshrines four fundamental principles - translated from Bangla, they are nationalism, secularism, socialism and democracy. Today, growing religious radicalisation across the globe means we cannot deny that secular ideals are being challenged. Both Iran, and recently Egypt are instances of secularism’s defeat by radical Islam. A secular state ensures separation of state, ie the public sphere from individual/communal beliefs and concerns, ie personal sphere. Public figures are expected to be guided by logic and compromise, and not allow personal beliefs to directly or indirectly influence decisions in the pubic domain. But it is up to the state to place checks and balances to ensure religion or belief systems do not become the primary influence in any decision making process related to the state. The Bangladesh Supreme Court’s (SC) decision to revert to the original Constitution of Bangladesh signals a return to the original guiding principles. It upholds the High Court’s landmark verdict on 29 August 2005, declaring the infamous Fifth Amendment (1979) illegal, and essentially putting an end to religion based organizations’ involvement in politics. The Shahbagh movement and subsequent calls to ban religious parties from politics, has reignited the debate, with a campaign of misinformation and fear mongering typical of religious extremist groups sweeping across the country. Without oversimplifying the complex nature of an individual’s relationship with religion, the constitution does not “ban” religious parties from politics but sets precedence to curtail religious orthodoxy within civil society. Concerns about religion based political parties wanting to change the legal and constitutional structure to incorporate doctrines they believe in are not unfounded given how easily they have infiltrated the political scene in the past. Future “governments” can’t be allowed to fail to uphold secularism, despite political and personal loyalties. The court’s decision guarantees the right and freedom to practice a religion or express lack of belief, without fear. The constitution actually goes one step further than guaranteeing secularism: the Bangla word used is “dharmanirapekhata,” it implies neutrality and non-involvement, in matters of religious theory, doctrine and practice, and guarantees religious non-discrimination and protection for all faiths, including non-believers, and clearly states it is the responsibility of those in power ie the state to ensure these rights.

    "title": "Of lungis and national pride",
    "body": "“Choli ke piche kya hai? (What’s behind the blouse?)” was a song that sent India into a tailspin in the early 90s. The moral brigade termed it vulgar. A lot of us sniggered at the provocative innuendo. I think what was forgotten was the following line that answered: the heart is behind. I wonder if the members of the Baridhara Society (appropriately BS) ever heard that song. Their version must be wondering what’s under the lungi? Hmm. Actually, what does the lungi connote? Why did it send a section of the Bangladeshi social media scene into a tizzy? What was so harmful that it required police in riot gear and shotguns to stop a group of lungi clad youngsters from going to Baridhara? But most importantly, why did BS think it was not up to snuff to be worn in their neighbourhood? I initially thought the ban was so ridiculous that it must have been a publicity stunt by a lungi manufacturer who recently launched a television commercial where it showed Bangladeshis marching with pride in their national dress. Is it our national dress? I will argue it is the most popular dress. Well, maybe after the sari. But somewhere in our desire to move up the social standing we seem to have abandoned it. So, the higher one goes up the ladder, the more “western” the attire. I find it absurd that in the heat of the summer I have salesmen making calls in full business attire. I myself did that when I first joined the work force. Matter of fact, I had quite an enviable tie collection. In the initial days I found that if I wore it to a new office, I was ushered into the inside meeting rooms rather than waiting unceremoniously at the common reception waiting area. Within a few years I found myself outside again. It was then that I noticed other salesmen wearing the tie and I was no exception. So I abandoned it in favour of an open collar shirt and jacket. Back I was in the board room. That’s when it struck me that in corporate Bangladesh, clothes did make the man! I was introduced to the lungi when I was 12 by my father. I wore it for a few years before going off to boarding school and subsequently university where I moved to pajamas and boxers. I rediscovered the lungi after a trip to Cox’s Bazar where I picked up a few from the Burmese market. Over the last 18-20 years it has been what I slip into as soon as I reach home. Aaahh! As another television commercial said: “Nothing more Aaram!” I have thought of wearing the garment out in public a few times, but actually never had the guts to. I often wondered to myself why. I still remember seeing a particular celebrity chef who I saw wearing one at a wedding, and thought to myself how well he carried it off. During my high school days in Tamilnadu, it used to be the formal dress. A compulsory attire for weddings and such. But here we rather wear a suit or at best a “punjabi.” So what is our national dress? Our founding father popularised the sleeveless coat. President Zia the safari suit. President Ershad the achkan. But none are practical for the Bangladeshi weather. The punjabi, as the name suggests isn’t some thing what was invented here. Matter of fact another popular outfit is the Arab robe that is common amongst mostly religious men. Interestingly the Arabs also wear a lungi like garment called the izaar. The lungi can and should therefore be the prime candidate for the position. Now if that is the case, should we not see a full adoption of it in our everyday work and social life? This is clearly not the case. We have lost our sense of pride and identity, and we have a misguided belief that everything international is “modern.” This is sad - because if “dil” (heart) was behind the choli (blouse) surely our national pride is beneath our lungis!

    "title": "The true face of the garment industry",
    "body": "With all the blaming, speculation and misinformation going around, I would like to put in my two cents as a garment manufacturer. For over 30 years, this industry has been the backbone of development in Bangladesh. It may not be evident now but Bangladesh is where it is today because of the apparel sector. No other industry has employed so many or brought in as much wealth into the country over the last three decades. Every other industry: service, hotels, transportation, and even real estate has developed due to the multiplier effect from the apparel sector. From sweatshop conditions we have evolved to manufacturing under international standards. The majority of the facilities have outstanding standards of compliance, employee benefits and conditions. Many exceed international norms. The majority of the workers in the industry are happy, well paid, and well taken care of. This industry would not thrive if that were not true. However, with the prosperity and the nature of this business allowing for easy entrance for newcomers there has been a surge of fortune seekers and opportunists. This is not uncommon in Bangladesh. We have seen it in stock market manipulations, banking scams, political scandals, etc - this kind of greedy, reckless, brazen raping of the system is rampant in our country and this is made very very easy by the corruption and intentional oversight of the authorities. The only difference is that they are not playing with people’s lives. In the garment industry, since so many lives and humans are involved and directly affected, this kind of recklessness is absolutely unacceptable. Even though this industry is the largest employer and contributor to GDP, we are portrayed as opportunists and slave drivers, but this is not true in a majority of cases. A handful of deviants, getting the most visibility are besmirching this whole industry made up of millions of individuals. Astonishingly, the latest incident was caused not so much due to the garment factories but the bad judgment of a goon who had made lots of easy money and knew nothing about construction and ethics. Granted that the small factories he rented out his building to also showed very poor judgment. But is it fair to blame the whole industry for the infractions of these fools? Deviants and opportunists exist in every country and every business. See the numerous financial and political scams even in a developed country like the US. One cannot avoid the human greed factor. However, it can be controlled and discouraged by proper regulations, enforcement, and punishments that need to be doled out. This is severely lacking in Bangladesh. Rather, our culture of corruption, nepotism, and general looting and plunder of the country by people in power encourages deviant behaviour. The victims of this dysfunctional system, of course, are the poorest people in the country, paying with their blood, and sometimes their lives. And the apparel industry is the apparent scapegoat. I do not justify by any means what is happening now. The repeated, enormous loss of lives is absolutely heart-breaking. Like everything else that is going on in Bangladesh, it is saddening and sickening. But I question the judgment of those who are putting pictures of jeans steeped in blood on their Facebook profiles. Without knowing the background or the consequence of their actions, they are defiling an industry that has been one of the key forces in keeping Bangladesh propped up and from falling into a mire of poverty. I can understand people from outside the country feeling this way about this industry and its practices, but it is unacceptable for our own people to support this image of the apparel sector and upholding the misconceptions of the west. I am sure there will be many detractors to my sentiments, people who possibly consider themselves conscientious demonstrators but from my viewpoint I feel they are ignorant and recklessly tarnishing the reputation, not just of our industry, but also our country. I pray for the victims of this tragedy and hope no more lives are lost due to this kind of negligence. Governance in our country needs to improve drastically for this, but for now, the good news is, that behind the scenes there is a lot of work going on both by the authorities and the owners to improve the compliance and proper monitoring of the manufacturing facilities. Hopefully this will have a positive impact in deterring further incidents although we may not see the results immediately. Wasim Rahman is a garment manufacturer.",

    "title": "Intellectual property rights in Bangladesh",
    "body": "Bangladesh is rapidly taking steps towards establishing itself as a mid-income country. Socio-economic indicators demonstrate that Bangladesh is a strong emerging economy and a culturally enriched nation. This emergence has been gradually recognised worldwide and the international media has reported that Bangladesh may surpass western countries by 2050. These rapid developments have been fueled by the relentless entrepreneurship of locals, government policies, increased availability of technology, creativity and artistic works. History shows us that creativity and artistic works have been major sources of economic and cultural growth in this part of the world. The creative talent from Rabindranath Tagore to Kazi Nazrul Islam, from Lalon Fakhir to Hasan Raza have always been a ray of hope in this poverty stricken land. However, extensive infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR) have discouraged creativity and deprived artistic works of their economic value and protection of originality. Although signs of improvement are evident in various aspects of our economy, our creative and cultural industry is still at a nascent stage. The balance of power is still tilted in favor of publishers and phonogram producers. There are not enough precedents in our industry guaranteeing the rights of the author/creator. Even the late great novelist Humayun Ahmed had not signed any concrete agreements with publishers to ensure the copyright of his books. Therefore, there is a general lack of confidence, awareness and professional support for creators and authors, which is being exploited by those engaged in piracy. The ominous dark shadow of piracy has not only affected the authors but the publishers as well; they too are taking a huge hit in terms of finance and goodwill. Moreover, the industry itself has failed to play a potent role in addressing the issue of piracy because a negligible response is received when personalities from the creative industry are asked to participate for this cause. The lack of response is also evident in that the creative industry has been unable to establish a Collective Management Organization (CMO) which would further the interest of creators in protecting their rights. Thus, people involved in piracy are taking the advantage of this lack of co-ordination in our creative industry and are continuing to sell counterfeit products. One of the major hurdles with regard to stopping piracy is the lack of awareness among the creators as well as the general public. Most creators don’t have a comprehensive idea about their rights and their innocence regarding this issue is exploited by the corrupt people who are engaged in piracy. For example the songs that are played in shopping malls without the prior permission of the creator is also an act of copyright violation, of which the creator doesn’t have proper knowledge. There is also a lack of understanding among the common people regarding copyrights. Very few people understand that the pirated material they purchase from footpaths and other stores is an act of crime, and a punishable offense. The general perceptions among people about pirated materials are that these materials are cheap and are sold in front of law enforcement agencies openly; thus it is not a crime and considered a norm. Also, the legal framework of the nation doesn’t provide adequate support to innovators. Therefore, what is required is a collective effort to trigger a paradigm shift both in terms of perception and practice. If we do not take a stern step at this moment then our country will gradually, and completely fall victim to piracy, resulting in the death of creative pursuits and entrepreneurship!

    "title": "Buyers are culpable too",
    "body": "Much has been said about who’s to blame for the sorry state of garment workers’ rights, safety and working conditions in Bangladesh. Some people, including some local manufacturers, would like us to buy in to the narrative of exploitative buyers whose predatory negotiations force our manufacturers to cut costs (because they are afraid they would otherwise lose the order to China or others) in order to stay competitive, and that leaves the latter with little (once costs of inputs, overheads etc, have been deducted) to pay to the workers. Barrister Moin Ghani wrote a fantastic piece explaining how the math of this just doesn’t add up. I’ve never met a poor, struggling-to-make-ends-meet manufacturer. Have you? I’ve met lots of garments workers who don’t even get paid a living wage. The RMG sector still remains a profitable sector for entrepreneurs. If the sector did not promise profit, I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t have close to 5000 factories in the country and an annual trade of 20 billion dollars. But buyers are also culpable. In 2011, at a meeting between buyers, unions and activists in Dhaka, labour groups proposed a safety plan that would establish an “independent inspectorate to oversee all factories in Bangladesh, with powers to shut down unsafe facilities as part of a legally binding contract signed by suppliers, customers and unions.” This would have cost about $500,000/year to the retailers/buyers. The buyers rejected this plan, with Walmart saying it was not financially feasible. H&M said it believed that this should be the [financial] resposibility of the manufacturers and the government. To my knowledge, there has been no discussion about all three parties sharing the financial responsibility and the state taking up the administrative role. Do buyers have regulatory or legal responsibilities over manufacturers in Bangladesh? No. The Compliance Code and the auditing they enforce before sourcing a supply in developing countries like Bangladesh and its competitors in the region are not legally binding. To what extent buyers are able to monitor and enforce safety standards in over 5000 factories in a $20bn industry, without any support from a state that seems quite complacent with the status quo, is another question. In the case of the factories of Rana Plaza, should the buyers have sought to see the building permit for the complex to check if it was compliant with our building code? Let’s also remember that Tazreen garments and two of the factories in the Rana Plaza had passed the standards of a major European group that does factory inspections in developing countries, because the buyer’s compliance code focus on labour issues, not building standards. A friend argued: “If a compliant factory says they can’t go lower [price] because of their costs, when someone comes along and says I can do it for much less, surely they [buyer] should know his costs are lower, and this is because his factory is inferior.” These low-operating-cost factories, with abysmal working conditions (at least by the conventional compliance code of buyers), usually take up the sub-contracted orders when compliant factories cannot complete the orders themselves (either because of efficiency issues or external factors such as power shortages, strikes, etc). There is no doubt that the buyers incite these bidding wars. But my point is, should such factories even be allowed to operate? Since they are often sub-contractors, they don’t have to comply. Who holds them accountable? As mentioned, the Compliance Code is not legally binding in Bangladesh. A manufacturer is unlikely to face severe legal repercussions, like having his/her factory shut down, if s/he does not comply with buyer’s code. However, hypothetically, what if we did have our own legal compliance code? What if we had a legal framework to ensure that the actions of garment factory owners leading to these deaths did not go unpunished? With regards to worker safety, the responsibility of inspection lies with various state institutions, eg the Directorate of Labour, fire services etc. It’s really their job to ensure that factories operating within Bangladesh, using Bangladeshi labour, are operating with safety standards set out by our labour laws. There are only about 85 inspectors in charge of implementing these standards and about 5,000 garments factories. According to a HRW press release, the Inspection Department, under the Ministry of Labour, has just 18 inspectors and assistant inspectors to monitor an estimated 100,000 factories in Dhaka. We know that Sohel Rana, the owner of Rana Plaza, was advised to close the building down by an engineer. Now, it isn’t entirely clear if the engineer who checked the building was a government inspector or if he was actually ordered to close the establishment down, because the law says that the government inspector can order the shutdown of an establishment if there appears to be imminent danger to human life or safety, according to Bangladeshi labour law. Tazreen was certified as a compliant factory by Walmart and it had fire exits. But the factory authorities had violated existing safety laws — they had blocked the exits with materials, some of which were flammable, and closed the gates on the workers, preventing them from escaping sure death. This indicates that we are still unable to implement existing laws with regard to safety standards in a way that protects workers’ interests. How else could Rana manage to build a 8-storey building without a valid permit? Imagine if we had an independent, well-resourced, autonomous body, whose job it was to inspect factories and ensure that they met all labour and safety standards. Imagine the difference that would make. Truth is, Bangladesh is a hostile place for workers — including the 4m employed by the $20bn garment industry. Buyers are fully aware of this fact. Manufacturers are even more aware because they are directly responsible for this hostility — labour groups have always questioned the immense political clout of the BGMEA, which has little influence over its members, let alone all manufacturers, aside from the certification given to these factories on the use of imported duty free inputs. So those who are not using duty free input (locally produced textile materials) are not liable to BGMEA, except for potential loss of membership. But ultimately, the state is to blame for the sorry state of worker rights. The state aids and abates this hostile environment by repeatedly siding with the interests of the manufacturers, instead of the workers — it has failed to punish a single manufacturer whose negligence and greed have resulted in the death of workers. The state is responsible because it is the state that has failed to ensure that existing laws are implemented and standards are enforced — it is responsible for this system of political patronage that allows a Sohel Rana to construct an unsafe building and factory owners to force workers to work in it, with impunity. The state keeps reminding us how important this sector is, but has failed to create a body that is responsible for the welfare of the workers whose sweat and blood keeps this sector strong. The state has failed the workers by not ensuring that they can form trade unions, because that would go against the manufacturers’ interests.

    "title": "Moving forward from the tragedy",
    "body": "The meeting of the BGMEA on April 27 has concluded with a few resolutions. One of them is the requirement that the factory is structurally certified by a group of engineers. They will have to shut down if there are cracks in the building. All fair. But how will Bangladesh continue to occupy the second position as an exporter? And how secure will the workers be? In the midst of all these queries, what will possibly be lost are the stories of those who have left us, those who have survived with amputated limbs, and those heroes who have braved the death traps. Will lessons be learnt? Yes. Will corrective measures be taken? Yes. Will that be enough? No. The reason is simple: it’s not possible to change the overall infrastructure overnight or even in three to six months, or even a year or two. The government is not in a position to either give us adequate land or utilities. Then how will the industry survive? It won’t. As far as our image is concerned, we are doomed. It will take multiple rounds of international lobbying and domestic efforts to rescue what we have lost. We, the manufacturers have lost ground. The retailers may be placing their bets on us with revised, lower prices, but at the end, on the negotiation table, we will cave in to their threats of “take-it-or-leave-it” and we shall all comply with all their demands, without batting our eyelids for even a second. Their demands will most possibly contain a revised building integrity code, which will simply lengthen the compliance checklist and besides that, there will again be columns marked “Corrective Action Plan” (CAP) which the manufacturer will have to fulfill. In our CAP, we will all be giving fresh dates to the retailers, assuring them that everything will be good by then. The reality is, we take weeks to rectify a leak in the toilet, months to build a new door, and years to mend our ways. So, our Corrective Action Plans could take forever. November 24 last year (Tazreen), and April 24 (Savar), have left us with a sense of shame and regret that will be difficult to reconcile. But even then, many of us have defended our position. The building owner has, to start with. The endless talk shows on television and the associated interviews have covered all the industry leaders. At a press conference, we, the manufacturers have tried defending the factory owner saying that the building owner is to be blamed, as he had overruled the possibility of a disaster. To all who defended the manufacturers and shifted the blame elsewhere, or to all those who have underplayed the multiple tragedies in our industry, a clear message should be conveyed: the buck must stop here and now. The industry cannot stand in defence and the administration cannot pick sides and plan “press” handouts. As a manufacturer and an exporter, I sincerely urge BGMEA to at least take a few initiatives: 1) Ask at least 500 good factories to donate Tk200,000 each and create an instant disaster management fund that can help the victims and their families; 2) Ask the same 500 to take responsibility of at least 3 workers affected by the tragedy; 3) Disallow members using shared buildings; 4) Engage with retailers to set up a specialised rehabilitation unit for the survivors; 5) Audit production units in three phases, beginning with the riskiest, followed by riskier and risky; 6) Appoint lobbyists to do some damage control and help secure the future of the 4m workers in the industry. Bangladesh must survive this tragedy. As a result, the RMG sector needs to present its case to the retailers out there. The whole country needs to stay united in the face of this disaster. The manufacturers’ community needs to join hands in prayer and plan a few actions which will not sound like a politically correct press release, but rather, a gesture of us standing together in shame and regret. We, the manufacturers, need to take collective responsibility to fight the battle that awaits us. The threat of withdrawal of GSP from the US and the warnings from the European Union on safety and security are only two of the fireballs that are coming our way. The greatest test will be to stand before our own people and come out clean, with a sincere intent to protect the lives that earn our daily bread. On the 24th, after having come back from Savar, I posted the following in social media, with which I’d like to end this piece: “[I] Never thought there would ever come a time when we would be ashamed to introduce ourselves as garment manufacturers. Today however is that day. I forgot to recite: inna lillah at the site, possibly because the proximity of tragedy and sin often numbs and kills the spirit.” For me, that says it all. Amen.

    "title": "Companies fear bringing new primary shares in a depressed market",
    "body": "A mood of caution hangs over the initial public offering (IPO) in the back drop of heavy volatility in the capital market, fear of unfair IPO pricing and economic slowdown, market analysts said. Over the last two years, IPOs were often tense with market marred by a number of shelved share sales and the poor performance of those stocks went public. Issue managers and analysts fear the disappointments over the last two years might well carry on into this year too as depressing sentiments still persisted in the IPO market. Political uncertainty is the new addition to it, they said. “Volatility is the bane of IPOs,” said Mahmood Osman Imam, a market analyst. Entrepreneurs might have been shying away from stock market because of negative sentiment and economic slowdown, he said. The benchmark index of Dhaka Stock Exchange, DGEN, lost more than half of its value since December 2010, when the market began to slide and it is still maintaining the falling momentum. Imam said that extended periods of heightened volatility are the most treacherous for new issues. “But reversals can be quick, if we see a measure of repair and stability.” Bangladesh Bank says GDP growth will be around 6.2% this fiscal year, which falls far short of government target of 7%. The World Bank recently revised down its GDP growth forecast for Bangladesh to 5.8% due to slow exports and investments. “Heightening political tension will intensify the GDP forecast,” said Imam, also professor of finance at Dhaka University. Owing to the unsettled market, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has cautiously taken steps to relieve the pressure on the country’s equity market caused by the backlog of companies waiting to be listed, but in slow process, said an official. The IPO market remained sluggish since the beginning of 2011 when the market boomed and then doomed as the regulator has tried to boost investors’ confidence by limiting new issues. The backlog of IPOs filed with the BSEC so far stands at more than 50, the highest level not seen before. “Majority of the issues submitted with the BSEC is not top quality. We are careful to give approval,” said a high official of the BSEC. The commission also asked some companies to cut higher premium taking the current market situation into account, he said. The backlog has also discouraged both issuer and issue manager for not filing fresh IPO with the regulator because of time consuming process. “IPO backlog has put a lid on going public for the companies,” said MA Hafiz, president of Bangladesh Merchant Banks Association. “A large number of companies are planning to put their IPO plans on the backburner because of the present condition,” said Hafiz, also a director of AAA Consultant, a leading issue management company. Companies hardly file their plan in recent months for future IPOs, a bright spot in an otherwise dim market. One issue manager has said that it was abstaining from managing IPOs because of the risk of dealing with small companies of unproved quality and also delayed process. “Recently, I have discouraged a company not to go public right now as the delayed process might affect its investment plan,” he said. The pace of IPOs, however, picked up in January this year when six new issues were approved after a slow of two year. In 2012, 10 private companies raised money through IPOs amounting to Tk10.17bn in Dhaka Stock Exchange. Seven private companies made IPOs worth over Tk1.4bn at the Dhaka Stock Exchange in 2011 — a year of gloom as the market lost one-fourths of its value to Tk2.6tn. \"Fund flow acts like the oxygen in the IPO market,” said Hafiz. So, more new issue means more fund flow, he added. Yawer Sayeed, a capital market analyst, said: “Wheel of IPO flow needs to keep running for the economic growth.” The roll-call of the companies hoping to list shares seems cautious because of the concern about reputation risk and volatility,” he said. Since 2005, IPO activity began to rise to tap the primary markets, taking advantage of growing demand for shares. “Maintaining the normal flow of IPOs is very important to overcome any shortage of quality issues in future,” said Akter H Sannamat, managing director and chief executive officer at the Union Capital, an investment bank. “But lack of approval for IPOs in view of the present market situation continued to hamper the IPO flow,” he said. In mid-last year, Envoy Textiles and Summit Purbanchol Power Company had to shelve their IPO plans as the outlook for a recovery seemed murky. A good number of companies -- Unique Hotel and Resorts, Saiham Cotton Mills and Aamra Technologies Ltd -- lost value below their offer prices in first trading day last year. The dismal debut of these companies has made many companies scary about going public. However, the most recent debutants received impressive responses from the investors, pushing up their prices higher than the offer prices. But this euphoria ended in heavy price corrections within next few days.",

Flatness returned in the bourse as strong resistance helped DGEN avert setting another bottom.

Turnover improved a bit as it stood at Tk1.35bn, up 19.64% over the previous session. “But sentiment is still depressive amid worries in the socio-political front,” said IDLC. Positive Q1 declarations seemed forming ripples throughout the bourse as witnessed by some scrips - Samorita Hospital that gained 8.42%, GHAIL 8.75%, and GBB Power 4%. Telecommunications and pharmaceuticals made good advances among major sectors while engineering and fuel and power sectors remaining largely on the slide. Moreover, micro-cap companies continued to demonstrate highest movement in the flat but volatile market. “Prospective investors are asking for higher return as recent political uncertainty has reduced the visibility of earnings growth of companies,” said Lanka Bangla Securities. It said some of the cash paying companies are trading at such price that their dividend yield almost equals the interest rates of time deposits. Newly listed companies posted strong gains.

    "body": "Sohel Rana, the owner of Rana Plaza, has been captured near the Bangladesh-India border. Four of the businessmen who had factories in the building are also in custody, and a petition has been placed with the high court demanding Tazreen Fashions owner Delwar Hossain be arrested in seven days. All of these are very encouraging signs. The trouble is the record for businessmen being brought to justice over offences that led to the death of their workers is dismal. In fact there is none.According to the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), over 6,400 workers have died in incidents related to negligence and/or deliberate and targeted violence, over the last 12 years. Not a single garments businessman has ever been held responsible for these deaths. No trials have been held against them, and not one of them has served a single day in prison for these crimes. During the same period, scores of garments workers have been arrested, beaten, shot at and even killed for demanding that justice be done, or even, absurdly, for demanding they be paid the wages they are owed. That such a high-profile industry with so many international connections and indeed international obligations, employing millions of people and bringing in billions of dollars, can operate this far outside the purview of the law, is extremely worrying. Also worrying is the BGMEA’s comments about the industry’s “image crisis” -suggesting that it doesn’t have an actual problem, just a perceived one. But perhaps the recent arrests will start a new trend in this industry. Perhaps the bad apples will finally stop getting away with murder.",

    "title": "Anwar Ibrahim: Challenging one party rule in Malaysia",
    "body": "Malaysians will go to the polls on May 5 in what is predicted to be a closely fought election, with 55 years of one-party government being challenged by Anwar Ibrahim, leader of the People’s Justice Party and head of the opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat. Campaigning for the ideals of empowerment, justice and equity, the coalition is calling for an end to corruption and the reform of civil and democratic institutions. Anwar Ibrahim emphasises social justice, poverty eradication, education and civil society and he has been a powerful symbol of integrity in the shadowy world of Malaysian politics for many years. He was a former deputy prime minister in Malaysia, holding various cabinet positions in agriculture, commerce, education and finance before becoming right hand man to former prime minister Mahathir. While finance minister he was recognised as an “Asian tiger” and Newsweek named him its 1998 “Asian of the Year” for his role in rescuing Malaysia from the Asian financial crisis. When establishing a reform movement, he courageously accused the prime minister of corruption, which led to his temporary downfall and six years in jail on trumped-up charges. Emerging from the politically motivated accusations in 2004, he gained a notable result in the 2008 elections, winning one-third of the seats and five states from the incumbent National Front party. Attempts to smear his reputation again failed when accusations were finally dismissed last year for lack of evidence. He is regarded as Malaysia’s best hope against an autocratic and corrupt government which many think have ruled Malaysia for far too long. The incumbents are using the usual tactics such as tampering with the electoral rolls and using huge amounts of public money to campaign against the opposition. At speeches and rallies Anwar Ibrahim is compelling, charismatic and persuasive as he remains steadfast in his trust in true democracy and his faith in the wisdom of the people. His followers are joining him in their hundreds of thousands in the call for electoral reform and an end to corruption scandals, crime and police brutality. Anwar knows well that he is up against a well-oiled propaganda machine that calls itself “Moderate Malaysia” and controls the media’s often empty vote-getting slogans which distort the meaning of freedom, democracy and human rights. His own coalition is a triumph of bringing to consensus the disparate elements of his People’s Justice Party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic party and the ethnic Chinese Democratic Action party. He has managed to bring them together into a broader liberal community through “active and vibrant intellectual discourse,” acknowledging extremists with respect and tolerance. The objective is a multi-party democracy where leading parties will change every few years as a way of being accountable to the people, putting an end to the single party domination of Malaysian politics. The twin issues of corruption and living costs are of major concern to voters. Anwar’s People’s Alliance has established a good track record in the states it currently governs, and he told reporters on April 4 that he was “cautiously optimistic” about winning a majority in parliament. The people of Malaysia have become more aware of national issues and their right to criticise, question and condemn their current rulers whose excesses and extravagances have no limits. In the culture of patronage and political largesse, huge sums of public money have been squandered in failed economic ventures and speculative projects, which certainly have not benefitted Malaysians. Education, housing and health services are all in need of upgrading and investment and the country suffers from stagnant wages and a huge and growing national debt, as the government borrows to maintain handouts to retain political power. It is a tragic state for a Muslim country to be in, as it has moved far from the tenets of Islam which include moderation, piety, justice and fairness to all. The Pakatan Rakyat offers the best hope of reform and change and the fact that the coalition contains diverse interests and competing ideologies can be seen as one of its strengths. By bringing together different ethnic and religious groups the PR coalition is more representative of a truly democratic Malaysia, more concerned for the good of the country and all its people than the nationalist Malay group represented by the ruling Barisan Nasional. If the nation is to eradicate poverty which is one of the often repeated campaign promises of the current government, then mismanagement, corruption and abuse of power will have to be replaced with a moral government with the interests of the people at heart. Anwar Ibrahim has an opportunity on May 5 to save his country from the one-party rule that threatens to hold back the country with stagnating ideas and economics; hopefully the people of Malaysia will recognise the moment for its historical significance and give Anwar Ibrahim the chance to lead his country to a renaissance of integrity, prosperity and true democracy.

    "title": "Deshi workers in the Kingdom",
    "body": "Recently, The Economist published: “Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia: The revenge of the migrants’ employer,” on their website. The article tracks data over the last few years of Bangladeshi migrant workers to Saudi Arabia. The data is what it is, and it is fair to say that the sources can be trusted. However, The Economist’s take on the matter, where the lower number of Bangladeshi workers migrating to Saudi Arabia can be attributed to retaliation by the Saudis to the war crimes trials (WCT) in Bangladesh that are now seeking the death penalty for leaders of Jamaat, may or may not be true. It’s not the only possible story. And I am not even sure it’s the right story. If one analyses the same data from a different perspective, the interpretation can be very different. For the sake of being prudent, lets look into alternate explanations. The peak was in 2007, and the big fall had taken place by 2009. If I recall correctly, no one was talking about hanging anyone in 2009. The WCT started in 2010, with formal trials delayed until 2011. In 2009, AL was busy hanging the August 1975 killers, not Jamaat leaders. Looking back to 2011, the Jamaatis were quietly confident that they would survive a trial (their confidence may have been warranted). This is why I am not so sure that the WCT is the reason behind the Saudi slump. What’s the alternative story? Well, once we take Pakistan out and we can tell a pretty simple story — Saudi demand peaked during the boom years when oil prices were sky-high, it collapsed with the onset of the financial crisis, and hasn’t rebounded. Of course, this is not a full story. After all, Pakistani numbers continue to be strong. Perhaps it’s the Pakistani series that needs explaining, keeping in mind what is happening to labour demand in the kingdom overall. Are Pakistanis and Bangladeshis substitutes in the Saudi market? Look at the numbers once again. There are 1.5m Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia, and 2.5m Bangladeshis. Yet, both countries received $3.7bn in remittance. All these numbers are from the Economist article. Simple arithmetic tells you that the average Pakistani sends more remittance payments than the average Bangladeshi. This suggests that the average Pakistani earns more than the average Bangladeshi. Therefore, it remains unclear whether or not they are actually substitutes in the Saudi labour market. Now the question arises: “Why are there more Bangladeshis than Pakistanis in Saudi to begin with?” If one looks at contributing factors (political, social, etc), it would make more sense for Pakistanis to outnumber Bangladeshis. Here is an alternative theory. Bangladeshi labour used to be fairly cheap and docile in earlier decades. But over the past decade, as their numbers have increased and their opportunities elsewhere have become brighter, the workers have become more vocal. Saudi employers don’t like the concentration of 2.5m Bangladeshi Muslims (1.5m Pakistanis are presumably not homogenous, ditto for the Indians) who are becoming increasingly “troublesome.” Steam had been building up for a while, and the 2008 crisis acted as a catalyst. Now the Saudis are looking to diversify their labour input. Hence the observed outcome. Is my story correct? I have no idea. But it fits the data points just as well as (if not better than) the WCT story. An abbreviated version of this article was posted on alalodulal.org.",

    "title": "Wrong words at the wrong time",
    "body": "By making threats to take over Bangabhaban and re-issuing the threat to besiege Dhaka on May 5, Hefazat proved itself to be extremely thoughtless and callous to the nation’s sensibilities, especially in light of recent events. One would have thought that, since they claim to be genuine Muslims, they would have had enough compassion to delay the siege or, at the least, refrain from speaking of it in the manner they did on Saturday, at a rally held in Lalbagh. Instead, they had the gall to dub the collapse of Rana Plaza “a curse from Almighty Allah,” which is preposterous, considering all the news reports and accounts about the real culprits behind the collapse. This is akin to insulting the hard-working RMG workers who died and dishonouring their memory. This is akin to offending the thousands of workers and family members traumatised by the tragedy. This is akin to slapping the survivors in the face for trying to support their families. At a time when the victims of this disaster need compassion and assistance, at a time when Hefazat could have stepped up its efforts en masse to help them, thereby showing true piety, they resorted to intimidation. It was the wrong thing to do at the wrong time. The Hefazat leaders should not have spoken so rashly. They should have taken a leaf out of the Prophet’s (SM) life, and been more compassionate. That would have been the Islamic thing to do.",

    "title": "Lessons from the tragedy",
    "body": "As a former member of the Bangladesh navy and having had training in fire, safety and disater management - I deplore the shocking demise of the victims of Rana Plaza’s collapse in Savar as easily avoidable and extremely ill-managed. While this is not the first time a fire or building collapse has caused the death of many Bangladeshis, the death toll of Savar’s recent tragedy is the highest among such incidents. The rescue operation currently running in Savar has been extremely unprofessional and uncoordinated. The lack of command and training combined with a tremendous shortage of supplies resulted in failure to deal with the crisis and subsequent death of those who survived the collapse. Materials were collected in a piece-meal method, which indicates that the nation was not prepared to deal with any sort of disaster. The entire nation is now worried about any future disaster. It is terrifying to think of how the nation would deal with an earthquake. To deal with the crisis, the prime minister deployed the army and other supporting units, putting them in command of the rescue operation. Unfortunately, they were unable to manage the situation effectively, resulting in a huge civilian presence joining rescue efforts. This meant that necessary safety equipment was spread very thinly across those involved in rescue efforts. The command unit should have cordoned off the area, allowing entry only to indivuduals engaged in the rescue. Next, a large number of sub-operation teams consisting of members of the army, navy, air force, fire brigade, police, RAB, medical team, and volunteers should have been organised. These sub-teams should have been deployed in various parts of the site to carry out search-and-rescue operations. There was a clear lack of organisation of the search-and-rescue team, the material-removing team, the medical team, the supporting team, the material-supplying/logistic team, the water and food supplying team, the ambulance/transport control team, the oxygen/SOS medicine supplying team, the dead body monitoring and disposal team, etc. The search for the survivors was carried out in a very haphazard, out-dated and unprofessional manner. The rescuers should have been using portable CCTV cameras with microphones and movers to find the highest possible number of survivors. The CCTV cameras should have been put through different holes to search and detect the position of the wreckage, as well as the condition of the victims trapped inside. Even a dog squad could have been used if one was already trained for such a situation. If these methods had been utilised, the rescuers – having a clearer idea of the situation inside the building — could have taken prompt decisions on the course of action and many lives could have been saved. Moreover, the search-and-rescue members were found using portable flashlights, which are unsuitable for such operations. They should have been using helmet-mounted search lights instead. To make matters worse, untrained people were engaging in the rescue. While it is a good sign that so many people were willing to help, their interference in the operation may have resulted in further loss of life. Instead of randomly joining in, they should have waited for instructions from those in charge of leading the rescue operation. What is most disturbing about this operation is that the victims’ relatives were allowed to enter the wreckage and join the search. Their desperate cries and frantic behaviour not only emotionally disturbed the rescuers, but also obstructed the progress of the operation. These relatives should have been taken to a separate area and provided the necessary information to satisfy them mentally and morally. The sad fact of the matter is that the standard operatiing procedure (SOP) was not followed at any level. It would have been possible to save more lives if the SOP and above mentioned methods of search and rescue had been followed. It is alarming that if an earthquake or any such disaster were to occur, 90% of us would probably die due to poor disaster preparedness and inadequate rescue operation equipment. The recent tragedy of Savar is yet another wake-up call for us. We should not wait any more. It is time we trained and prepared ourselves in all respects to face any sort of disaster. I would like to bring to the notice of the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry the following few recommendations: - A joint, mock nationwide disaster exercise should be conducted in which defense forces, police, BGB, fire brigade, medical services and several other sections will participate and learn to coordinate and handle crises. There should also be periodic refersher exercises to check and improve efficiency. - The use of modern search and rescue technology be made mandatory. - Logistic arrangments and an abundance of all necessary working equipment and material may be kept in ready stock for immediate use. - Purchase and maintain an abundant store of digging/breaking instruments, helmets with search lights, etc. - The use of a general information board by the monitoring cell indicating the operation activities and providing information to the public. - Adequate provision of food, water, medication, etc, during such disasters to trapped victims. - All sorts of propaganda be resisted through an immediate, justified statement to avoid aggravating the situation. - Practice during mock exercises of providing necessary directives to people engaged in the operation, and practice of other responsible persons about being cautious in providing any sensitive statements. - In the event of a disaster management crisis, all talk shows should be held with positive intentions in order to avoid aggravating the public and hindering an effective operation. - All locally and internationally trained professionals should be called upon to share their knowledge and experiences on how to operate a highly effective disaster management operation. Regular seminars should be held as well. - Seminars at different levels may be organised at regular intervals to enrich knowledge on disaster management. - An official press briefing should be arranged at the end of every disaster operation that pinpoints shortcomings and future remedies. - Performance of case studies on every inquiry report and implement the best recommendations. - Formation of an advisory committe of highly qualified disaster management professionals. - The dog squad of army/Rab should be trained and utilised to expedite search and rescue operations. - All personal safety precautions should be taken by all involved, including use of appropriate safety gear. The nation is grateful and appreciates the wholehearted efforts and immediate action taken from all sides to save many lives during the Savar disaster. Thanks to all for their support/assistance in helping survivors and continuing rescue operations. Discipline, coordination, better organising capacity and timely action are the prime factors in conducting any disaster operation. Training on these issues is a continuous process to enrich and refresh knowledge and produce an effective result. Awareness and preparedness are the most effective tools in saving lives. Finally, let us pray for the departed souls that they may find eternal peace, and may those undergoing treatment be blessed with early recovery. May Allah give strength and support to distressed families in the nation. Commander S. M. ILIAS (E), BN (Retd) is a former Navy Officer.",

    "title": "JS passes demutualisation bill 2013",
    "body": "Parliament yesterday passed the much-awaited Demutualisation Bill-2013 to bring more transparency in the country’s twin stock exchanges. The house enacted the law by vote in absence of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party as Finance Minister AMA Muhith proposed its passage. The bill gives out a positive signal to investors and other stakeholders that the excessive control enjoyed by brokers over the stock markets would end. Passing of the demutualisation law has been welcomed by the stakeholders saying the law would bring more transparency in capital markets, leading to a higher degree of trust among the investors. At present, the owners and managers of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) enjoy the right to trade the security issues. The law requires the stock exchanges to be demutualised within 90 days and the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) will approve the demutualisation scheme within next 60 days of its promulgation. As per the bill, the independent director will hold the post of chairmen of the DSE and CSE. The stock exchanges would be operated by independent directors, owners and strategic investors. After the demutualisation of the stock exchanges, majority of the board directors will be selected from independent directors. The bourses will also be able to raise funds from the market through initial public offering. The stock exchanges can also sell shares to strategic investors. The BSEC will formulate a guideline for the appointment of independent directors. The aspirant independent directors with required qualification will have to apply to the BSEC for appointment. Presently, the country’s twin stock exchanges are operating as non-profit companies with a mutualised structure where the members have ownership as well as trading rights. This structure creates conflict of interest as members predominantly control the affairs of the stock exchange which results in lack of transparency in the operations and compromises investors’ interest. DSE senior vice president Ahmed Rashid welcomed the law and said that it would bring more transparency in stock markets which would lead to a higher degree of trust among the investors. “This is the beginning of a new era for country’s stock markets but the results will be visible in short period of time,” he said. An official of BSEC said that the law provides a framework for the corporatisation and integration of the stock exchanges. “The most significant benefit is that the supervision and enforcement in stock exchanges will not be in the hands of the brokers. It will also assist in expansion of the market outreach, resulting in larger number of investors, improved liquidity and better price discovery,” he said. “Besides, a demutualised stock exchange will be in a better position to attract international strategic partners and good quality issuers.” Bangladesh was among the few growing markets lacking demutualisation as almost all stock exchanges worldwide operate in a demutualised set up. Earlier, the bill titled “The Exchanges (Demutualisation) Act-2013' was placed in the parliament on March 03 last and on the day, it was sent to relevant committee for conducting necessary scrutiny. On September 27, 2012, the BSEC approved a draft of the law as per preparation of assisting the government to enact a law in parliament. After the stock market debacle in January 2011, market experts were advocating for demutualisation of the stock exchanges to ensure greater transparency and accountability.",

    "title": "FY14 tax target set at 14.2% of GDP",
    "body": "Finance Division has set a target to increase the tax-GDP ratio by 0.8 percentage point to 14.2% in the next fiscal year despite having the challenges of political unrest and apparel factory collapse at Savar. “It’s a new estimate by finance division, but is unlikely to be achieved with having the ongoing political unrest coupled with the possible impact the Savar incident,” National Board of Revenue (NBR) Chairman Md Golam Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune. He explained that the reactions from the international market to the factory collapse might have an impact on the revenue collection in the days ahead. Finance Minister AMA Muhith has asked the revenue officials to raise the tax target to 14.2% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for 2013-14 from 13.4% of the outgoing fiscal year and 10.2% in 2011-12. At a pre-budget meeting with the ruling party lawmaker’s Sunday, he pointed finger at the revenue growth in last three fiscal years to argue in favour of the tax target. The ongoing political unrest and frequent shutdowns (hartals) have already started taking toll on the revenue collection as NBR apprised the Finance Division of the adverse impact. It leads to an aggregate shortfall in the tax collection by Tk43bn in the first three quarters of the current fiscal, it said. It has in fact posed a threat to achieve Tk1.12tn target of the outgoing fiscal year, said the NBR. The resources committee of the government has set a revenue target of Tk1.36tn for the next fiscal year. “The tax-GDP projection is quite ambitious for the next fiscal year because of political unrest and the deadly incident in Savar,” Dr Zaid Bakht, research director at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), told the Dhaka Tribune. He pointed out that the country’s macroeconomic situation is now under tremendous pressure due to external shocks. Abdul Bayes, professor of economics at Jahangirnagar University, said the introduction of value added tax has boosted the revenue performance over time, but the lack of modernisation of tax administration is still an acute problem in generating sufficient resources. He said a fast turnaround is urgently needed to raise tax-GDP ratio to roughly 15% by 2014-15. The objective of reaching the target is to reduce dependency on the trade taxes – it would require fundamental changes in tax laws and modernisation of tax administration.",

    "body": "Bangladesh missions in foreign countries across the world have expressed deep concern over the deadly building collapse at Savar, and asked for details of the rescue work and the government’s steps in this regard, official sources said yesterday. Commercial councillors at the European Union, the USA and the African countries already sent e-mails to the commerce ministry and wanted to know how the government was handling the matter, said a senior official of the commerce ministry. He said they recommended the creation of a separate cell under the prime minister’s office to manage the situation. Sources at the commerce ministry said, apart from the garment factory owners, the higher-ups of the government, ministries and divisions were deeply worried over the matter. Due to the incident, retention of the US General System of Preference (GSP) for Bangladesh has become complicated now, they said. The commerce ministry sources further said the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisation (AFL-CIO), a US-based labour rights body, was disturbed by the photographs and documents of the Savar tragedy. As a result, the authorities concerned have been asking the Bangladesh missions about the actual situation. The commercial councillors of the US, the UK and Canada sent several queries to the commerce and labour ministries regarding the Savar tragedy so that they could respond accordingly. The EU buyers have already moved to find new markets in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Laos and Cambodia, sources said. Commerce Secretary Mahbub Ahmed yesterday told reporters: “We are deeply concerned about the matter and forming strategies to [prevent] the fall in garment exports.” The president of the Exporters’ Association of Bangladesh Abdul Salam Murshedy told the Dhaka Tribune that following the Rana Plaza tragedy, efforts should be made to find a way forward.",

The decision emerged from a meeting of Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB) and Association of Bankers' Bangladesh (ABB) at Bangladesh Bank yesterday. The meeting also decided to donate one-day salary of officials of all scheduled banks to the Prime Minister's relief fund to help the victims. “Of the fund to be raised from salary, a portion will be donated to the Prime Minister’s relief fund and the remaining will be spent for buying rescue equipment which will be handed over to the authorities concerned of the government,\" BB Deputy Governor SK Sur Chowdhury told reporters after the meeting. The special relief fund will be created separately to help victims of the tragic incident, he said. Standard Bank Chairman and FBCCI President Kazi Akram Uddin Ahmed said we want to stand beside victims of Savar tragedy. “We've decided in principle to form a special relief fund… the amount an individual bank will be able to contribute to this fund will be determined in next 15 days,” he added. If the country’s all 50 banks contribute Tk20m each to the special fund, the size of the fund will stand at around Tk1bn, he said The meeting also discussed about possibilities of providing jobs in different banks to those who have been working with the rescue team of the army and other forces from the very beginning of the incident as per their respective educational qualifications. Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Atiur Rahman presided over the meeting attended by BAB President Nazrul Islam Majumder, ABB President Nurul Amin and top executives of all banks.",

    "title": "Spain sinks deeper into recession in first quarter",
    "body": "Spain's economy shrank for the seventh straight quarter from January to March, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, and the recession looks set to last into next year. Acute joblessness and grim economic data from Spain and other eurozone countries have fuelled a raging debate over whether Europe should abandon austerity policies that are still favoured by regional powerhouse Germany. Spain's Gross Domestic Product contracted 0.5 percent in the first three months of this year from the last quarter of 2012, according to preliminary data from the National Statistics Institute, dragged lower by sliding domestic demand. The Spanish government slashed its economic forecasts for this year on Friday, bringing expectations closer to consensus, though did not announce any significant updates to its vital reform plan designed to restart the economy. “We recognize the reforms of the government have been significant, but the problem is the starting position of the Spanish economy was much worse than any other European economies and adjusting in this environment is a lengthy process,” analyst at Nomura Silvio Peruzzo said. “We don't see Spain returning to growth until sometime next year.” The economy shrank 2 percent on an annual basis in the first quarter, worse than the 1.9 percent registered a quarter earlier and the worst annual contraction since the start of the current recession in the last quarter of 2011. Spain has been in and out of recession since 2008 when a property bubble burst and put millions out of work and gutted consumer and business confidence. The country is still struggling to replace the once-booming construction sector to boost growth. The eurozone's fourth largest economy has been on the front line of the bloc's debt crisis on concerns over one of the regions highest public deficit, prompting Madrid to pass a slew of austerity measures critics say has hobbled recovery. The government, meanwhile, says the worst of the slump has passed and sees quarterly growth before the end of this year mostly because the country has become more competitive and exports are growing. “All the indicators which look forward in Spain point to recovery, and a much better economy than one year ago,” Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said in a radio interview on Tuesday.",

    "body": "Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) is planning to open a regional office in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to promote two-way investment and trade between Bangladesh and the countries of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The office is to help organise trade missions and exhibitions as well as events to promote business events that will benefit the business community of both the countries, DCCI President Sabur Khan told a business meeting with Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Abu Dhabi on Monday, said a press release today. GCC countries comprises of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, Oman and Qatar. Khan also expressed interest to engage more with large businesses of the GCC countries and explore investment and trade opportunities that will help boost economic relations with the Gulf countries, where a large number of non-resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) live, work and also do their businesses successfully. More than 10,000 NRBs own businesses in the UAE that employ about 75,000 people, out of the 800,000 Bangladeshi expatriates that last year remitted $2.4bn to Bangladesh. Of these, Dubai Chamber has more than 1,500 Bangladeshi-owned companies amongst its 110,000 plus registered business entities. Director General of Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce Mohamed Helal Al Muhairi expressed the interest to invest in ceramics, petroleum, oil and gas sector in Bangladesh. A MoU was also signed between DCCI and Abu Dhabi Chamber at the meeting to work together to boost bilateral trade. The DCCI delegation, which attended the World Chambers’ Congress in Doha last week, is currently in the UAE — its final leg of a two-week Gulf-wide tour. It will attend a two-day Africa Global Business Forum that starts today. Bangladesh’s two-way trade with UAE, Qatar and Bahrain reached $1.13bn in 2011-12 financial year ending June 30, 2012. The GCC countries are host to more than two million NRBs who collectively remit more than $8.32bn a year. A number of NRBs have helped bring in foreign investment to Bangladesh. UAE’s RAK Ceramics, ETA-Star Group have already invested in Bangladesh while a large number of NRBs have already invested in Bangladeshi economy.",

    "title": "Japanese airlines report earnings after Dreamliner woes",
    "body": "Japan's two-biggest airlines said Tuesday they would take a revenue hit of more than $200m from the grounding of Boeing's Dreamliner as the troubled aircraft takes to the skies again. All Nippon Airways (ANA) and rival Japan Airlines (JAL), which reported full-year earnings Tuesday, together account for half of the Dreamliners in service globally and had to cancel thousands of flights in the wake of the crisis tied to the next-generation jets' lithium-ion batteries. JAL said it was \"trying to minimise\" the financial impact from the three-month Dreamliner grounding, but said its full-year profit dipped 8.0% as rising competition and soaring oil prices also took a bite. \"The three-month period was long, so I am relieved that there were no major troubles during that time so we could save customers' trust in us,\" said JAL president Yoshiharu Ueki. ANA, which operates 17 of the Dreamliner's 50-strong global fleet, said its fiscal year net profit soared 53.1%, as cost-cutting and a boost in demand for international travel helped it shrug off its Dreamliner woes. The firms said they expected revenue in the past and current fiscal year would come in about 22.5bn yen ($230m) lower due to the Dreamliner issue, though ANA said the pain would be lessened if it can restart flights by June as the next-generation aircraft undergoes a battery fix. ANA Chief Executive Shinichiro Ito, who flew in a Dreamliner test flight Sunday with a top Boeing executive, said that \"we also responded flexibly to minimise the number of cancellations affected by the grounding of the Boeing 787 from January, minimising its impact to profit\". The fleet grounding in January came after a number of incidents including a fire on a JAL plane in Boston, and an emergency landing on an ANA flight in Japan. After months of investigations into the plane's powerpacks, US authorities on Thursday issued formal approval of Boeing's battery fix, followed by a similar move from Japanese regulators. Ethiopian Airlines on Saturday become the first carrier to start using the aircraft again, while ANA ran its test flight the following day. But it could still be at least a month before the whole Dreamliner fleet is back in the air. Manufacturer Boeing took out full-page advertisements in major Japanese newspapers on Tuesday to atone for the troubles with its fuel-efficient plane. \"We deeply apologise to Japanese customers and companies affected for the trouble and concern caused by our new Boeing 787,\" it said. JAL, which re-listed in Tokyo last year after a high-profile bankruptcy restructuring, said its net profit in the fiscal year to March came in at 171.7bn yen ($1.8bn), while it slashed its full-year earnings outlook by almost a third to 118bn yen. Sales rose 2.8% to 1.24tn yen in the 12 months to the end of March, it added. ANA earned 43.1bn yen in the year to March, up from 28.bn yen a year earlier, as revenue climbed 5.1% to 1.48tn yen, it said. The carrier expects a 45.0bn yen net profit in the current fiscal year. A weaker yen, which helped Japan's exporters, has also marked a challenge for the country's airlines. \"Because they procure fuel in dollar-denominated prices, the cheaper yen weighs on Japanese carriers' earnings,\" said Nomura Securities analyst Masaharu Hirokane. The Japanese currency has declined steeply in recent months as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his hand-picked team at the Bank of Japan roll out a big spending and aggressive monetary easing agenda that is aimed at stoking the world's third-largest economy. Japanese airlines have also been hit by a row between Tokyo and Beijing over sovereignty of a group of islands in the East China Sea, which triggered anti-Japan rallies across China and a consumer boycott of Japanese brands.",

The 4-day meeting begins tomorrow at India Expo Centre and Mart (IECM) in New Delhi. Muhith is expected to return home on May 6. Some 4,000 participants, including from global media, will discuss how vulnerable groups could better access economic opportunities and social services like health and education. This year’s governors’ seminar titled “Beyond Factory Asia: Fueling Growth in a Changing World” would examine the future role of factory-driven manufacturing in the region, alternative growth sources, and how individual countries can move up the production value chain to avoid becoming mired in a middle-income trap. Seminars will look at the challenge of creating productive, meaningful jobs in Asia, the steps needed to quicken and deepen regional integration, including South Asia’s fast expanding links to its Southeast Asian neighbors, and the measures needed to mobilise more long-term finance for Asia’s huge infrastructure needs. Besides, sessions will be held on development aid, and ways to boost falling levels of assistance; as well as how to improve the delivery of public services to poor and marginalised groups; and financing the universal healthcare. On the sidelines, finance ministers and other officials of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the People’s Republic of China, Japan and Republic of Korea, (known as ASEAN + 3) will also hold discussions.",

    "title": "Empire to ashes",
    "body": "Oh, Bangladeshis. We’re everywhere. There are 160m of us: living, working, studying, raising families and building intricate networks. We are teachers, activists, health care workers, artists, scientists, writers, politicians, business owners, doctors, drivers, sellers of wares. Yet, we’re nowhere. Our “unfinished revolution” permeates the consciousness of every single Bangladeshi living on this planet, whether we realise it or not. Those who survived 1971, and we the children of those who survived, living in America, Britain, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Japan, Australia and elsewhere — we bear witness to the memory, the healing and old horrors. Bangladesh seems to have overtaken India in terms of social indicators of development. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen spoke at a lecture at the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, less than a month after the Delhi gang rape. Sen asserted that a “large number of women health workers or school teachers has actually helped [Bangladesh] to overtake India in every aspect of the Human Development Index.” Without gender equality there can be no development, as the refrain goes. At the present moment, post garment factory fire, post garment factory collapse, there’s much more progress to be made. Buried under the rubble, among the dead, with more to be found — are mostly women. With the feminisation of Bangladeshi labour, women compose the rickety backbone of Bangladesh’s ready-made garments industry, which is 77% of Bangladesh’s total export economy. They are indispensible, one would suppose. But conditions within the factories make us realise otherwise: low wages, decrepit buildings, eight to eighteen hour days depending on the expedience of the order, constant bladder infections, sexual abuse and coercion are among the many horrors workers face in Bangladesh, and in garment industries worldwide. Sumi Abedin, a survivor of the November 24 fire at Tazreen Fashions describes her salary to Democracy Now: “I was making $55 per month as a senior sewing machine operator. And including overtime, I was making $60 to $65 … working 11 to 13 hours per day and six days in a week, sometimes seven days.” As garment factories collapse into rubble and burn to ashes, it’s high time to demand the unionisation of garment workers and all other workers in Bangladesh. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch says: “Had one or more of the Rana Plaza factories been unionised, workers could have refused to enter the building the day it collapsed. This tragedy shows that the right to organise a union in Bangladesh is not just a matter of getting fair wages – it’s a matter of saving lives.” Workers’ livelihood is at the forefront of change. Bangladesh cannot simply churn out ready-made garments with zero human rights accountability. Racking up the GDP in the globalisation rat race won’t buy a world where the war is a thing of the past. And when these tragedies happen, it is apparent that the war is still very much present. Flash-forward to the Shahbagh protests, which swelled to grand proportions after a former war criminal was spared the death penalty. His irreverent and unapologetic thumbs-up after his verdict catapulted folks onto the streets. A collective roar called for his death, justified, they believed, for his murderous, rapist ways. But why calls for death? The torturous murder of Aminul Islam, a leader of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity, reminds us of how quickly dissidence is met with depravity. It’s almost as if collective muscle memory expects dissidence to be dealt the hand of violence. We believe we cannot depend on the police, the army, the government to guide us with compassion and democracy. Or protect us. Until her death, African-American futurist and science fiction author Octavia Butler, wrote stories of a dystopian world. She foretold a future ruled by violence, chaos. She wrote: “The past … is filled with repeated cycles of strength and weakness, wisdom and stupidity, empire and ashes. To study history is to study humanity. And to try to foretell the future without studying history is like trying to learn to read without bothering to learn the alphabet.” Without bothering to learn the alphabet. If the alphabet was one of the first movements toward independence, certainly forgetting our alphabet is to forget history. Forgetting history? Well, we all know about that. No future.

    "title": "Authorities should have authority",
    "body": "Despite being governed in line with a pro-people constitution focusing on mainly those who are poor and marginalised, the successive governments since the birth of Bangladesh have been failing to establish a nation where the driving force [elements] of the state system are sensible about the people in general, and serve them with their highest efforts – due to the job responsibilities and obligations of standing for office. Since its birth 42 years back, ordinary people have been unable to reach the higher echelons of government – that are supposed to be formed by politicians elected as lawmakers by the people’s vote. The helms of the top two parties that have ruled the country most of the years since independence have been occupied by single persons and/or their families. Therefore, even though only a few reliable and efficient leaders could reach the higher rungs of these parties, they had to stop or were forced to stop at a certain stage. As we have experienced, the mindset of the government heads, developed through their family and social orientation and assisted by political norms, are often pro-business in the name of pro-development. The development theory generally aims at planning sustainable development tools for poor communities, executing those through ventures involving the government and non-government organisations, monitoring and research on the implementation and reassessment of previous development plans – everything in line with constitutional guidelines. Impressed by project proposals, developed to assist millions of people, many foreign governments and organisations extend their hands too. The people become happy when they hear about such initiatives through media and public addresses by political leaders and government representatives. And at the same time, they pray to Almighty God that the funds are not embezzled by dishonest officials and public representatives. But, they are cheated! Even though the people are paying taxes every day in many ways, they are hardly heard or attended to by their elected officials in government, reportedly, because the rich people, mainly the businessmen, pay higher and snatch the attention and benefits that every citizen should be ensured. The perception of the successive governments resembles the rich’s view though they can’t say that in public due to constitutional obligations. However, they express their pro-business stance at all times, except for when they attend humanitarian campaigns or civil society discussions or address the nation as a whole. At present, over two-thirds of MPs are engaged in business while most government officials have investments in different business too. Invest and return has been the key driving philosophy of the time; it is rapidly spreading among the people as they are deprived and cheated by the governments they elect as their representatives. Hence, for quick access to public funds and projects, these deceptive people join the political parties in power, or join other influential groups, or just bribe corrupt officials and party leaders. Some people protest the misdeeds – mainly corruption and irregularities – while the majority, who are sarcastically called “ordinary people,” stay mum and deal with the consequences, which are often brutal. This piece is merely a psychoanalysis; here, figures and facts of growth, economic indicators, and government data on the success stories in reducing harmful indicators in some sectors [poverty, mortality rate, agricultural production, literacy rate] are not supposed to suppress the “ordinary” people’s voice, which portrays the inhuman characteristics of the present leading quarters in our society that influence the government mechanism. And interestingly, when leaders of the political parties address people, they mean their people [supporters], not those apolitical ordinary people. In a relatively stunning economy like Bangladesh, those people who are privileged and holding responsible positions involving the people, need to take a second look at their perceptions and attempt to look at things from different perspectives; reassess their aims that are irrationally higher than what they need; shun the rowdy game of invest and return; stop favouring only the people who pay higher taxes and making mountains with coins, often by snatching or cutting others’ pockets. Justice for the ordinary people is what should be ensured first in a country like ours where the majority lives from hand to mouth and can’t find a way for generations to rise above chronic poverty. People who are unable to see the light of development easily. We feel frustrated during every government term, when we hear that the ministries and other agencies indulge in massive corruption, irregularities and nepotism, and the authorities entrusted to punish the culprits have no effective or strict authority to address the crimes. A similar scenario is seen these days in the private sector too. This culture of apparent “weakening of the regulators and also the supervising entities” is supported and adopted by all political parties that are handed power. Say for the ACC, the corruption watchdog, or the SEC, the stock market regulator, or the BERC, which oversees the power and energy sector, or the UGC that monitors higher education, or the Board of Revenue, or the BTRC that regulates the telecommunications issues, or the BRTC, the transport regulator, or the Election Commission, the DoE, the environment regulator, or the Directorate of Health, and even the parliamentary watchdogs, all these bodies as well as the other state components are constituted in line with the guidelines of the constitution. The already-rough road to achieve rights and get justice for the poor victims has been aggravated further by some dishonest politicians, public servants, and policymakers and officials of the institutes linked to the judiciary – law enforcement agencies and the court. But this should change, and it’s not impossible either. We have the guidelines stated in our constitution and we just need to honour and follow those, and uphold the “spirit of humanity” as Bangladeshi nationals. The writer is a journalist.",

    "title": "The view from the outside",
    "body": "As closet narcissists, we feel the world revolves around us. My world does too, with a slight twist. Call it a Canadian tendency for self-inflicted guilt, I find myself indirectly responsible for lost species; invasive new ones; for sweatshops in dingy buildings in the developing world; and, somehow the obesity epidemic too. When the first graphic of the rubble of Rana Plaza made its way to my computer, I literally dropped a household item I had been holding from Loblaws, a Canadian chain that carries Joe Fresh, one of the brands that was being manufactured in the ill-fated building. I vowed to not shop there again. Initially, it felt like another addition to my long list of begrudged embargoes: mass produced radioactive granite, leather sports goods from Pakistan, regulated antibiotics in butter, Nafta approved, sorry imposed GMOS, etc. But this time, there was solidarity in my conviction. Social media platforms were overwhelmed from boycott threats by conscientious Canadians. As the details started coming in, there were more questions than answers. In torrents of expletives Bangladeshi citizens were demanding a quick fix. In other words, a fast track trial, lynching, and, or pelting of the building owner who was well aware of the possibility of collapse. Unable to break free of dirty pre-election inertia, ruling and opposing parties reverted to the headless chicken run: prove a point, instigate hysteria on lien and lineage, find a punching bag, backtrack, assert self-importance, and debase the other. Bonus points were to be had if search and rescue chanced to fall within personal agendas. Mathew Coutts wrote in the Daily Brew that workers had “no idea that the financial benefit of having them hemming and sewing t-shirts and sweaters had been calculated and valued higher than their right to live.” And someone stopped me to ask: “Is it true Bangladeshi labor is so cheap that China outsources there?” Unfortunately, yes and yes to both scenarios. But surely, the social responsibility of retailer compliance is not manufactured in Bangladesh. Cannibalistic consumerism is surely not a phenomenon borne in the unskilled factory worker populations that died in Savar, or will succumb on the front lines of inhumane industries, unreported, and one at a time. Someone with an army of lawyers and accountants somewhere is well aware of the possibilities of deliberate risk exposures and gets away with it. Loblaws stated it hadn’t done enough to live up to its own standards, and relied on overseas audit firms for compliances. However, it says it wants to improve the physical safety of workers; the Worldwide Responsible Accreditation Program works towards ensuring the safety of garment workers; and somewhere in the tomes of legalese, there exists an ordinance called the Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety Agreement. So who takes it from self righteous disclaimer to translatable contingency measure? There are other questions that warrant answers in order to stop Tazreen and Rana Plaza from relocating to the next desperate postal code. Soon, on the heels of indignation, came statements from bleeding hearts and the BGMEA highlighting the garments industry as the backbone of the Bangladeshi economy. How long can a nation piggy back on an osteoporotic spine? Still fumbling to find pressure points in the complex consumer-manufacture supply chains, the blame scatters very thin. Workers, some desperately, others, as self expression, have taken to protests and property damage. Given that minimum wages are laughable and labor rights nonexistent, whose insurance pays for loss of income when they break the still standing garment factories? We, as consumers must learn counter-intuitively to place a monetary value on ethics and morality. But who proposes an ethical profit margin? Who builds accountability in the supply demand chain? The production cost for a Joe Fresh T shirt is less than a dollar. Doesn’t make sense, right? It shouldn’t, because the truth is, someone is paying for actual cost. The question is: Who? The one positive thing to have transpired in the wake of incident is solidarity and un-patronised nationalism. In a rare display of initiative and compassion, individual and private efforts have been amazing. Note to political leaders - save the saving of face for the parliament. Every person that comes out of the debris breathing is far bigger in the scheme of things than your own illusions of political celebrity. Kausar Shahab is a freelance contributor.",

However, let us not forget about the four garment factory owners, who are equally, if not more, responsible for the death and injury caused to the hundreds of RMG workers. As the building owner, Rana should be held accountable as well. Rana had the unsafe building constructed on precarious grounds without proper authorisation. Then, on the fateful day, he made the statement that all was fine, despite the cracks, and reopened the building, despite engineers’ warnings to keep it shut since it might come crashing down, which is exactly what happened. However, when all is said and done, the ultimate call to reopen the factories lay with the garment factory owners who went a step further. They bullied their workers into returning to work, and threatened them with pay cuts and job loss if they did not comply. They even used Rana’s goons to intimidate the workers back into the dangerous building when the workers refused to enter. Not all business owners acted ruthlessly. The manager of Brac Bank branch certainly didn’t. He made sure to evacuate all of his workers as soon as the warning was given, unlike the garment factory owners. Knowing full well the dilapidated condition of the building, but putting their own greed above the lives of their workers, the factory owners are just as responsible as Rana, if not more.",

    "body": "The recent move to start demolition activities at the site of the Savar tragedy is a continuation of poor decision-making by the authorities.While the move is certainly not unexpected, it is definitely premature. The past few days have made it clear that the manual rescue operation, which is geared towards pulling survivors out alive, should be continued – every delay that we have seen so far in the use of heavy machinery has seen more survivors being pulled out from the rubble. Once the machines go in, the chances to pull people out alive become significantly slimmer. Although the authorities have tried to make it clear that the use of machines is only the second phase in the rescue process, a mechanised rescue process lacks precision; as a result, it might increase risks to trapped survivors. The question that looms in everyone's mind, including ours, is: \"What's the hurry?\" Is it really necessary to go in immediately, when there is still a high probability that some may still be alive and are waiting to be rescued? Shouldn't the authorities regard all human life as sacred? As the leaders of the nation, the government has a duty to each and every citizen, including those still trapped, and the families that are hoping to be reunited with their loved ones. At one point the government had mentioned that heavy machinery would not be brought in until it was absolutely sure that no one remains alive. While it may be futile to hope that every family will be reunited with those they wait for, they should at least be given the hope that they can recover the bodies for proper burial – taking the chance away prematurely is cruel and insensitive. That the government is, in fact, reneging on a statement made earlier, makes the action even worse. The protests already raised should be a clear indication of what the public wants and expects from the government. When will it start to listen?",

    "title": "Supermarket owners want ‘package vat’",
    "body": "Leaders of Bangladesh Supermarket Owners' Association on Sunday requested the National board of Revenue (NBR) to introduce square-foot based ‘package vat’ for all the supermarkets after removing the existing 4% value added tax (VAT). The existing VAT system is discriminatory and hampering growth of the supermarkets as other shops pay VAT at a flat rate, they argued at a pre-budget meeting at the NBR headquarters in Dhaka. NBR member Farid Uddin chaired the meeting. Zakir Hossain, general secretary of BSOA, said that the growth of supermarket are being hampered due to the 105% duty being imposed on capital machineries used for the supermarkets, making it uncompetitive with the small local shops. He said the supermarket owners have to pay highest tax in importing capital machineries while other countries in the region are paying less than 15% and in India it is zero. “This punitive duty is a key reason why this vital sector cannot achieve growth as compared to neighboring countries,” said the association leader. “We are requesting NBR to initiate a unified standard which can increase the revenue of the government and help expand the industry.” Cab Association of Bangladesh (CAB) president Khandaker M Azad urged the NBR to reduce the import tax on taxi cab to 5% from existing 20%. “We are unable to pay VAT since the rate is very high for us. NBR could introduce a system to collect the VAT annually.” He also requested NBR to introduce VAT exemption facility for 1480 CC taxi cab. As per statutory regulatory order for importing taxi, importers will enjoy VAT exemption facility with taxi cabs comprising 1501-2000 CC. Representatives of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) said that all association members are paying income tax on behalf of their respective organisations, but NBR set a rule that the association will also have to pay income tax, which is discriminatory. “Since our association does not have income, we are unable to pay income tax for the association. We request NBR to remove this rule,” he said. In response, NBR member Farid Uddin said that NBR imposed source tax on income of the associations. “You do not have to pay any tax for contributions paid by the association members. Source tax will only be imposed on the association’s income like savings of the organisations at bank, rents generated from the association building etc,” he said. Security Service Owners Association representatives requested NBR to set full exemption of VAT instead of existing 15%. Bangladesh Thikadar Samity representative said that as per NBR rule, contractors, who have property pricing more than 10 million have to pay 10% additional income tax. He requested NBR to set full exemption of additional tax for such properties. In response, NBR member Farid Uddin said the rule has been changed and as per the new rule, the contractors have to pay 10% additional tax if he/she has property more than 20 million. On the same day, NBR held a meeting with Bangladesh Textile Mills Association leaders chaired by NBR Chairman Ghulam Hossain. To facilitate the country’s textile sector, BMTA leaders demanded reduction of income tax by 5% for the sector. BMTA president Jahangir Al Amin said the financial capability of the country’s textile sector has shrunk due to the current global economic recession. He urged the authorities concerned to reduce the rate of income tax to 10% up to 2018 from existing 15%. He also requested NBR to put off source tax from the sector in the coming budget. ‘Since textile sector is not enjoying tax holiday benefits, investment in the sector has became stalled. To inspire and patronise foreign direct investment, we propose NBR to initiate tax holiday facility till 2018,” he said. He also suggested constituting a fund to upgrade the country’s textile technology institute. To compete with the other countries, it is necessary to increase the rate of alternative cash intensive from 5% to 15% for the country’s textile sectors, Jahangir recommended.",

    "body": "The European Union is considering trade action against Bangladesh, which has preferential access to EU markets for its garments, in order to pressure Dhaka to improve safety standards after a building collapse killed hundreds of factory workers, reports Reuters. Duty-free access offered by Western countries and low wages have helped turn Bangladesh's garment exports into a $19 billion a year industry, with 60% of clothes going to Europe. But any action by the EU on Bangladesh's duty-free and quota-free access would require the agreement of all member states and could take more than a year to implement. \"The European Union calls upon the Bangladeshi authorities to act immediately to ensure that factories across the country comply with international labour standards...,\" the 27-nation bloc said in a statement issued by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht. The Swiss-based IndustriAll Global Union, which represents 50 million workers worldwide, on Tuesday set a May 15 deadline to finalise with Western retailers a commitment to a fire and building safety plan for Bangladesh. \"Funds will be made available for inspections, training and upgrades of dangerous facilities,\" it said in a statement and called on retailers to renegotiate contracts to pay suppliers more in order to guarantee living wages for workers and to enable technical upgrades to factories. About 3.6 million people work in Bangladesh's garment industry, making it the world's second-largest apparel exporter, behind China. The industry employs mostly women, some of whom earn as little as $38 a month. The factory collapse was the third deadly incident in six months to raise questions about worker safety and labour conditions in the poor South Asian country, which relies on garments for 80 percent of its exports. Clothes made in five factories inside the Rana Plaza building were produced for retailers in Europe and Canada. In the year to June 2012, Bangladesh's garment exports to the EU rose to $11.37 billion from $10.52 billion a year earlier, according to Bangladesh's commerce ministry. Germany is the main EU market at $3.4 billion, followed by the UK at $2.13 billion, Spain at $1.71 billion and France at $1.27 billion. Bangladesh's next biggest garment export market is the United States, which accounts for 23 percent, or $4.53 billion. Late on Tuesday, the EU said it would look at Bangladesh's preferential trade access to the EU market in order to encourage better safety standards and labour conditions. \"The EU is presently considering appropriate action, including through the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) - through which Bangladesh currently receives duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market under the ‘Everything But Arms' scheme - in order to incentivise responsible management of supply chains involving developing countries,\" said the statement. Ashton and de Gucht said they were deeply saddened by the \"terrible loss of life\", particularly because it followed a fire in the Tazreen Fashion factory in a Dhaka suburb in November that killed 112 people. \"The sheer scale of this disaster and the alleged criminality around the building's construction is finally becoming clear to the world,\" they said. Also on Tuesday, following a private emergency meeting of Canadian retailers, the Retail Council of Canada said it would develop a new set of guidelines. That meeting brought together retailers including Loblaw, Sears Canada Inc and Wal-Mart Canada, to discuss how to deal with the tragedy. Representatives of some 45 companies, including Gap Inc, H&M, J.C. Penney, Nike Inc, Wal-Mart, Britain's Primark, Marks & Spencer and Tesco, and Li & Fung, also met officials from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association in Dhaka on Monday to discuss worker and plant safety. Primark and Loblaw have promised to compensate the families of garment workers killed while making their clothes.",

    "title": "Ruling party suffers budget dilemma in election year",
    "body": "The Awami League government is in a dilemma over formulating the next budget this election year, official sources said. It has two options - curtail the annual development programme due to the need for cutting next fiscal year’s revenue earnings or borrowing more money from banks, they added. The budget for 2013-14 fiscal will be announced on June 6, according to the Finance Division, which is now considering a proposal to cut revenue estimate to Tk1.25tn from its proposal for Tk1.36tn. A senior official said one of the options to the government is to slash down the ADP size by Tk110bn from the proposed Tk650bn, as some incentives for the ruling party lawmakers will remain in the next fiscal’s ADP. An amount of TK30m for development of the lawmakers’ respective areas, along with allocation for the monthly pay order (MPO) for educational institutions, will be included in the next budget allocation, he said. The other option is to borrow Tk110bn from the banking system. As per Finance Division preliminary estimates, the next budget outlay will be Tk2.22tn, with a Tk550bn deficit and ADP outlay of Tk650 bn. Last month, the resource committee preliminarily set Tk1.36tn as NBR’s collection target for the next fiscal year, up from last fiscal’s target of Tk1.12tn. NBR Chairman Md Ghulam Hussain told the Dhaka Tribune that the prime minister and the finance minister are now examining the NBR estimation of Tk1.25tn for the next fiscal year. “In the wake of the deadly incident in Savar, along with the ongoing political turmoil, we have no choice but to estimate an amount of Tk1.25tn, instead of Tk1.36tn,” he said. Revenue earnings from the export sector may decline due to consecutive internal shocks, Hussain said, adding that it was now 0.8% of the total board of revenue earnings. Economist Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir of Dhaka University told the Dhaka Tribune that the government wants to impose a political compulsion on the NBR to increase revenue in the election year, without revenue board reform and modernisation. Titumir, who is also team leader of Unnayan Onneshan, an independent multidisciplinary think tank, further pointed out that the picture is likely to remain the same next fiscal year due to political unrest and the Savar incident. AB Mirza Azizul Islam, a former adviser to the caretaker government, and Dr Ananya Raihan, executive director of D.net, a social enterprise, said that revenue earnings in the next fiscal year should be realistic in the face of political turmoil and uncertainty of the domestic economy. They added that the government will make sure that expensive local resources are not used for financing the next budget deficit.",

    "title": "EPB asked to assess Savar tragedy impact on exports",
    "body": "The Export Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh has been asked to assess the possible losses of apparel exports to global markets in the backdrop of factory building collapse in Savar that left over 380 people killed. Commerce ministry officials said the assessment is to prepare for future strategies. Commerce secretary Mahbub Ahmed asked the EPB to prepare their assessment about the negative impact on global garment market because of the incident at Rana Plaza, which housed five garment factories, said a senior official. He said that the assessment is also to set strategy on how a negative campaign specially by a labour organisation linked to the AFI-CIO, a umbrella group of American unions, could be handled. EPB formed a four member committee on April 24 to investigation into the Savar incident. The investigation committee will also assess the impact on exports. Bangladesh offers the world's lowest labour costs with a minimum wage of about $37 a month for a garment industry job. Foreign missions and development partners want to know how they would handle the situation, commerce secretary Mahbub Ahmed told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday. “We will do everything to protect the possible impact,” he pointed out. He said the government would also hold discussion with the stakeholders concerned to impose tax on non-compliant factories. BGMEA President Atiqul Islam said that if necessary, they would discuss about imposition of compliance tax on non-compliant garment factories which will have positive impact on exports. A recent BGMEA estimate revealed that one-day shutdown (hartal) hampers production worth about Tk20m and export orders worth $2.6m have been cancelled due to shutdown while the amount of discount on the export was $1.13m due to the same reason. The Savar tragedy might aggravate cancelling the orders, sources in the commerce ministry said. A total of 4500 garment factories are in operation across the country, contributing around 80% of the country’s annual export earnings of $24bn.",

    "title": "Stocks rally on signs of political development",
    "body": "Stocks finished higher on Thursday, ending flat movement over the last two weeks as investors pinned hope on positive political development and reacted positively to impressive earnings reports by some companies. The market moved down at the very beginning, but started going up as soon as the news of Prime Minister’s offer for political dialogue spread across the market, analysts said. After falling 25 points in the morning, the benchmark DSE General Index, DGEN, closed at 3654 with a rise of 36 points or 1%, pulled by telecommunications, engineering and power sectors that soared more than 1% each. The newly introduced benchmark index, DSEX, rose 29 points or 0.85% to 3468. The DSE30 gained 1.7 points or 0.13% to close at 1284. The Chittagong Stock Exchange Selective Category Index, CSCX, was up 67 points to 6829. The market participation at the DSE saw a jump with total turnover going up by 25.4% to Tk1.7bn. Of the 272 issues traded, 204 advanced, 54 declined and 14 remained unchanged. “Despite a gloomy start, market eventually ended positive over improved political scenario and earnings surprises,” said IDLC Investment in its daily market analysis. “Activity boosted over corporate declarations, both DGEN and DSEX gradually climbed back. In addition, sentiment improved over latest developments in political scenario,” it said. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday invited BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia to sit for a dialogue to resolve the current political impasse, which coupled with the Savar tragedy badly affected the market during last two weeks. Among the best performing sectors, telecommunications gained highest 1.88%, followed by power 1.57%, engineering 1.53%, financial institutions 0.85% and pharmaceuticals 0.52%. Micro-caps companies performed better than others. But the market bellwether banks ended slightly lower. Trade was mostly centric on earnings expectations as eight companies out of top 10 turnover list had announcements this week. Earnings surprises pushed up Golden Son 7.35%, Premier Cement 4.72%, ACI 4.10% and RN Spinning 4.48%. United Airways continued to top the turnover leaders followed by Olympic Industries, Beximco, Titas Gas, Unque Hotel and Resorts, Square Pharma and RN Spinning.",

    "title": "Chevron plans to set up LPG plant at Bibiyana",
    "body": "The international oil company, Chevron, plans to set up a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) bottling plant in the Bibiyana Gas Field area, an official said. “We have sent a draft project proposal to the Energy Division for its approval,” Naser Ahmed, director (external affairs) of Chevron Bangladesh, told the Dhaka Tribune recently. Naser said Chevron had already discussed the project several times with officials of Petrobangla, the state-run oil, gas and mineral corporation. Director (PSC) of Petrobangla, Muhammad Imaduddin, said they welcomed the initiative to set up an LPG bottling plant – the first initiative by the IOCs operating in Bangladesh. “We have been examining the proposal and trying to reach a decision on whether the plant should be developed under PSC (production-sharing contract), or in the private sector,” he said. Currently, Bangladesh consumes about 100,000 tonnes of LPG, which is mostly used for cooking by residents in the district towns where piped natural gas connection is not available. The state-owned LPG producers now supply 20% of the total market demand, while the private sector imports the remaining 80%. Md Eunusur Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), also the monitoring agency for LP gas, told the Dhaka Tribune that private firms were importing 80,000 tonnes of LPG, while the government produces 20,000 tonnes a year against the annual demand of 300,000 tonnes. Industry insiders, however, claimed that the demand is not less than 500,000 tonnes per year. Demand for LPG is increasing rapidly, following a recent government policy to stop providing piped natural gas connections to household users due to a shortfall in production. Besides household users, a good number of small commercial entities, like restaurants and tea-stalls, also use LPG. The government has already exempted import duty on LPG, LPG cylinders and other accessories to encourage its use and reduce price, which has been on the rise in the local market over the past three years. While a residential user pays a fixed amount of Tk450 monthly for 24-hour gas supply through a pipe line, a 12.4 -12.5 kg LPG cylinder costs around Tk1,650-1,750. The cylinders are available from four sources – state-owned LP Gas Limited and privately-owned TOTALGAZ Bangladesh, Bashundhara LP Gas Ltd, Jamuna Spacetech Joint Venture Ltd, Linde Bangladesh Ltd and Kleen Heat Bangladesh. Chevron has interests in two PSCs in Bangladesh, covering Block 12 (Bibiyana field) and Blocks 13 and 14 (Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields) in northeastern Sylhet region. The company sells the gas it extracts to the government under long-term sales agreements. In 2012, net daily production averaged 550 million cubic feet (mcf) of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of condensate. The Bibiyana Expansion project, meanwhile, got a final investment decision in July 2012. The project includes a gas plant expansion, additional development wells and an enhanced liquids recovery unit. It is expected to increase the total maximum daily production by more than 300 mcf of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of condensate. First production is expected in 2014, and the project’s economic life will last for the duration of the PSC.",

    "body": "Sohel Rana has been crowned the most despicable man in the country. The man is beneath contempt and entirely liable for the enormous suffering his tumbled plaza continues to cause, but perhaps it requires mentioning that he is only as contemptible as the people who patronised him. Sohel Rana didn’t appear in a vacuum. In fact, it’s unlikely that he would have been anything at all, were it not for the fact that he was one of Savar MP Tawhid Jang Murad’s men. Jang has tried his best to disassociate himself from Rana, claiming that he doesn’t know him, but pictures of them together makes this less than credible. The fact that he inaugurated Rana Plaza and called Rana immediately after the collapse, before sending his men in to rescue him, makes it a complete lie. We ran a report about Tawhid Jang Murad on April 29, which shows the Awami Leaguer’s links to various illicit activities. The vice-president of Dhaka District Awami League calls Jang the ‘godfather’ of Savar. He has his finger in a number of pies, including construction, real estate and garments. Jang takes a commission from all construction work in Savar. He fills up lakes and sells plots like the one Rana Plaza was built on. He controls the surplus trade of factories like the ones housed in Rana Plaza. Sohel Rana was one of Jang’s men, and a particularly nefarious one, but the fact that Jang has men like him all across the constituency is the real cause for concern. The Awami League has distanced itself from Rana and has denied all claims that Rana was a Jubo Leaguer. But will they also be able to deny having anything to do with Tawhid Jang Murad, an AL MP? For the moment however, making Sohel Rana enemy number 1, might provide them with just enough of a smokescreen to evade the issue.",

    "body": "May Day, or International Workers’ Day, which was two days ago, is a commemoration of the international labour right movement, and is meant to recognise the contributions of the working classes everywhere, but, in the case of Bangladesh, the impact of this day hits even closer to home because of the recent tragedies that have killed and maimed so many of our workers. Back in 1886, police fired on workers in Chicago, USA – they had held a general strike for an eight-hour workday – and killed four demonstrators. The situation in this country, however, is vastly different, but no less tragic for our workers. The collapse of the Spectra building that killed 64 workers and injured at least 80, the shooting of protesting Bangladeshi migrant workers in Greece, the Tazreen factory fire which killed 112 workers, and, finally the Rana Plaza collapse in which, at last count, 429 have been confirmed dead, and hundreds more injured, come to mind. The reality is that our country’s workers are often treated little better than slave labour. Migrant workers are even more helpless. Labour rights are nothing more than a joke. This cannot be allowed to continue. The time is now to throw the door wide open on worker abuse, and force the public to sit up and take notice. The time is now to bring corrupt practices to a halt, to keep the spotlight shining on all abuses that go on, so as to prevent all liable parties from sweeping them under the rug. Let this be a reminder to stand beside our fellow workers in support, and work towards ensuring their labour rights. Let us truly embrace the purpose of International Labour Day. Besides, if it hadn’t been for such workers who made a stand, we might all still be working as virtual slave labourers. Something to think about.",

The three-page letter reads: the government has already taken several kinds of measures to prevent these types of catastrophe. Sources in the commerce ministry said the Export Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh submitted its initial report on Savar building collapse tragedy. The EPB report mentioned only the loss of lives and building, and quantity of garment items which were supposed to export to the Canadian and European retailers like Primark and Loblaw, and US retailers like Wal-Mart. Officials said the report has not covered the impact assessment on the readymade garment exports. Late Tuesday, the EU issued a brief statement expressing concern and suggested it would look at Bangladesh's preferential trade access to the EU market to encourage better safety standards and labour conditions. \"The EU is presently considering appropriate action, including through the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) - through which Bangladesh currently receives duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market under the ‘Everything But Arms' scheme - in order to incentivize responsible management of supply chains involving developing countries,\" said the statement, issued by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht.

In line with the Digital Bangladesh vision, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is going to organise the fair in collaboration with Bangladesh High Commission in the United Kingdom (UK) and Computer Jagot. A preparatory meeting was held yesterday at the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with its Secretary Md Nazrul Islam Khan in the chair. \"Bangladesh for the first time is going to organise e- Commerce fair in a foreign country aimed at making expatriate Bangladeshis and foreigners know about the opportunities that might be created through extending the use of services and products,” Khan said. He said the potential entrepreneurs of Bangladesh and UK will get the opportunity to showcase their respective products and services through the e- Commerce fair. Khan said though late, the government has already opened e- Payment gateway for paving the way for bringing money from outside country without hassle. But, many more is to be done by the authorities to break barriers on way to flourish e- Commerce, he added. \"We should sensitise e-Commerce by organising fair at home and abroad to create awareness about e-commerce,\" he Khan said, adding the fair in London would also help get different opinions of different quarters to explore the prospects of e-commerce. The meeting was attended among others by Executive Director of Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) S M Ashfaque, Additional Secretary of Ministry of ICT Kamal Uddin, General Secretary of Bangladesh Computer Samity Md Shahid-UL- Munir and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Computer Jagot Abdul Wahed Tomal. The meeting decided to talk to organisations like Bangladesh Bank and Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) to involve them with the initiative. Abdul Wahed Tomal said more than 80,000 people would visit the three-day fair in London. Expatriate Bangladeshis have already shown great enthusiasm about e-Commerce fair which would be a very attractive event to them, he hoped.",

In response to reporter’s queries, the chairman disclosed the decision after completion of pre-budget meeting with Chittagong Chambers of Commerce and Industries at the association auditorium. He said that to facilitate the operation, specialised software named ASYCUDA World will be initiated from the same day which will help the customs officials to evaluate the price of imported goods online. He said if the online system goes, importers will not need to pay 1% tax on imported goods. PSI system is going on in Bangladesh since 1999 which directs the importers to pay 1% tax on imported goods. Withdrawing PSI system has been a common demand of the importers for many years. Presided over by Chittagong Chamber president Mahbubul Alam, the NBR chair was present as the chief guest. Pointing complexity of PSI system and harassment by the customs officers, Mahbubul Alam requested revenue board to withdraw the system. He said, though the PSI system was initiated to ease the goods delivery system, prevent harassments of importers and increase the revenue, however the system was failed to serve its plan and it increased the complexity rather than removing the complexities. ‘In many times, if the imported goods reach at the ports, we do not receive Clean Report of Finding (CRF) which hindered the goods delivery system and take more time. The importers have to face harassment and financial losses for this system’, he said. The chamber president also demanded reduction of VAT on import of capital machineries, raw materials, intermediary materials and finished products. In case of capital machinery, he suggested the duty should be 1.5% from 3% while cutting it to 2.5% for raw materials from 5%, intermediate goods from 12% to 7.5% and finished products from 25% to 20%. In response, NBR chairman said that the suggestions will be given consideration in the coming budget. He said importance will be given to interest and expansion of local industries where the tariff structure rationalization, reduction of tax in raw material in compared to intermediary goods would be considered.",

Regarding the substitution factor, even though Pakistani people might be sending more money per person, they are the closest to the Bangladeshi workers and can actually be a substitute. Pakistan is not exactly a very rich nation and they would be willing to do the same jobs that Bangladesh did. It is a large country with a large population, many of whom are extremely poor. Another theory is related to the Saudi unemployment rate which is pretty high. Saudi government was really promoting and trying to push its people to work (they are generally considered lazy) and if necessary move into low earning jobs also. They raised salaries as well for Saudi citizens.",

Seeking to press American retailers to do more to assure factory safety in Bangladesh, dozens of worker advocates held protests on Thursday at the Gap’s headquarters in San Francisco and at a Walmart store in Renton, Wash. Labor activists and human rights groups called on retailers and global brands to help pay for programs to improve factory safety and upgrade fire prevention equipment, a need underscored by a November fire that killed 112 workers making shorts and sweaters for export. Activists say that spending about $600 million a year for five years could bankroll sweeping improvements to the country’s 5,000 garment factories — noting that global brands could finance such a program by agreeing to pay an additional 10 cents per garment for the more than six billion garments exported each year. Atiqul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, called on the owner of Rana Plaza and the owners of the factories inside the building to surrender to the authorities.” Mr Islam also said that the trade group would hire engineers in coming months to examine the structural stability of all the country’s garment factories.

    "title": "There is greatness amongst us",
    "body": "There is greatness amongst us, and this time the creature that had kept itself hidden behind copious uneasiness has finally come out. The overwhelming response to the recent episodes in Bangladesh is proof. Of course this greatness has been forced to come out to battle against a greater lingering “evil” that had kept itself hidden behind our shadows, in plain sight. Dare we say greatness will prevail? That depends on what we will take away from the Rana Plaza disaster. There are two very polarised opinions regarding the incident that I have seen floating around, having myself been engaged in some of the debates. One side blames the greed and negligence of capitalistic mindsets to be the cause of this debacle while the other argues for the importance of the RMG sector for our country, that the entire industry is not to be blamed for the stupidity of a few, while demanding the ban of a certain cartoon circulating in social media that depicts a pair of blue jeans with a price tag in blood. These two polarised opinions are merely two sides of a coin representing the age-old capitalistic debate - between inequality and unemployment. Do we cut the hand of the capitalistic sector in our country and thereby bring about more equality and are thus more responsible towards human lives (It has been shown that more egalitarian countries tend to be more responsible)? Or do we fuel the capitalistic economy that boosts our GDP and provides more employment for people who would otherwise be unemployed? First of all, this polarised state of mind is very limiting and none of the extremes are solutions. While I refuse to accept simply an increase in GDP as an accurate indicator for development, most sensible people agree on the important role of the RMG sector for our country, especially in creating employment, however cheap the labour may be. At the same time, there is no denying that what has happened is due to cracks in both the RMG industry and the building construction sector’s standards and enforcement. As one of my friends Afia Tasneem rightly commented: “How about leading Bangladesh towards better safety standards, better regulations and enforcement of those regulations so that bad mangoes can’t get into their crowd and ruin their image in the future?” The answer to achieving that lies in good, organised and effective institutions, especially enforcement institutions, which our country lacks. Simply reviewing safety standards will not help. That has been tried, and has failed, before. We are good at making laws but not at enforcing them. One of my favorite quotes regarding this incident has been put forward by Asif Saleh: “Sohel Rana is a symptom, not the disease.” And if we are to rid our culture of the disease, well-functioning and respectable enforcement institutions are required. Overseeing proper construction protocols, working conditions in factories, ensuring proper corporate conscience is vital. And the respective enforcing authorities have to be credible and respectable enough to ensure that. It is worth acknowledging that this is not a task that will be done in a year or two but will require several, well beyond the scope of any media hype. However, if we walk away (again) from the calamity without proper holistic restructuring of our existing system (that includes the factory owners, workers, and construction companies), we might as well accept the recurrence of such incidents. Of course if everyone’s moral compass was right, this wouldn’t be required. But alas, it is not and this will be the case in the coming decade. Morality in some companies has become an image, not a state of mind. Apt regulation and enforcement is required to amend exactly that. Finally, I hope that these polarised opinions are acknowledged as extremes, and that instead, we can work together to ensure saving that we save lives through prevention. Unity is key. Greatness will prevail. Adnan Fakir is working towards a MSc in economics at the University of Sussex.",

    "title": "Taking stock: Responsibility for the supply chain",
    "body": "After the building collapse tragedy at Savar, it has been reported widely that many of the garment factories were exporting globally to consumers across the world including the UK, Spain and Italy. With more than 300 people lying dead, this is a tragedy that has shocked the world. Primark, one of the retailers whose suppliers were based in the building, sells low-price clothing to their customers in the UK. People in Primark’s store in London can buy a shirt for the same price as a cup of coffee. However Primark has been criticised for low standards several times before. As a result, stores in the UK actually displayed a notice on the walls, alerting customers that they are working with suppliers to improve working standards. We now know they have not done enough - with fatal consequences. Consumers who buy these clothes in the UK have no idea where their clothes come from, so ultimately it is the responsibility of companies to ensure good practices. Can we really believe companies when they say they have ethical practices? Who is monitoring them? Human Rights Watch has reported that the Ministry of Labour is chronically under-resourced, with only 18 inspectors to monitor around 100,000 factories in Dhaka. It has been argued that globalisation leads to downward pressure on costs, and can lead to a “race to the bottom” towards lower social and environmental standards. However, we also must remember the garment sector provides jobs and livelihoods for millions of people. Working in the garments sector can lift people out of poverty when standards are kept to. After the fire in the Tazreen factory in November 2012, Walmart threatened to pull out of Bangladesh and may still do so. However, this would cause many low-paid workers to lose their jobs, who are already struggling to feed their families. It also emerged that back in 2011, Walmart and other large companies rejected a plan to improve safety conditions, saying it was too costly. Global companies that withdraw orders from Bangladesh after the tragedy will be taking an ineffective route - not addressing the problem. With more than 3m people in Bangladesh relying on the garment sector for their livelihoods, mostly women, it is critical that companies work to improve standards rather than shift their production from Bangladesh. Companies that move their production elsewhere after a tragedy are punishing workers twice: firstly with inadequate standards and monitoring, and secondly by leaving these people jobless when a problem gets attention. With the sector contributing about 80% of Bangladesh’s exports and worth over $19bn, it could be disastrous for the economy if companies just pull out. In globalised supply chains, transparency can be lost in a maze of suppliers and sub-contractors. There is now an urgent need for companies to sign up to the safety plans called for by workers’ groups. This would include independent audits and inspections. Companies must disclose their list of factories. Trade unions must also be allowed to form, so as to prevent such atrocities happening in future. There were tragic reports that workers did not want to enter the factory when they arrived that morning, fearing for their safety in the face of the cracked building. Brac Bank, in the same building, withdrew their staff after the safety warning, but factory bosses made their workers stay. The supply of cheap labour leaves such workers helpless. Oxfam estimates around 35,000 people move to the cities each week, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The incident might cause a backlash - but we must make sure that garment businesses learn lessons from this tragedy. As with other disasters, it is better to prevent the disaster occurring than have to handle the post-disaster trauma. The garment sector is not alone in suffering from this problem. Other supply chain managers and buyers must look to ensure the standards of their workers across the globe - otherwise they bear responsibility when tragedies occur. We must push companies to have a sustainable response - not to withdraw their orders, but to work to improve standards. Helena Wright is a researcher on disasters, currently based in Dhaka.",

    "title": "Rising up out of the ashes",
    "body": "Bangladesh, my country, is again in tears. Last week in Savar, a suburb of Dhaka, the capital, a poorly constructed building that housed garment factories, and other businesses, collapsed. More than 300 have been confirmed dead, and the final death toll could well exceed 700. Bangladesh is no stranger to disasters, both natural and man-made. Still, this is one of the saddest chapters since we won our independence in 1971, precisely because the tragedy could easily have been prevented. Structural weaknesses had been found but not fixed. The victims were among the most vulnerable in our society — hardworking people making an honest, but meager, living. Many died manufacturing clothing for Western brands. I appreciate the unease a Westerner might feel knowing that the clothes on his or her back were stitched together by people working long hours in dangerous conditions. It is natural that people in richer countries are now asking how they can put pressure on Bangladesh and its manufacturers to improve the country’s dismal safety record. But ceasing the purchase of Bangladeshi-manufactured goods, as some have suggested, would not be the compassionate course of action. Economic opportunities from the garment industry have played an important role in making social change possible in my country, with about three million women now working in the garment sector. I have dedicated my life to alleviating entrenched poverty, and I know that boycotting brands that do business in Bangladesh might only further impoverish those who most need to put food on their tables, since the foreign brands would simply take their manufacturing contracts to other countries. The rise of manufacturing here has had good effects. In the past, for example, a poor family’s vision for a newborn daughter’s future was often to marry her off as young as possible, since the dowry paid to a husband’s family grows as a daughter gets older. Even after the dowry was outlawed in 1980, the practice continued. A girl would often be married off as young as 13, and would never leave her village, never know a brighter future for herself or her children. Partly because many women and their daughters now take garment industry jobs — even in factories where workers’ rights are virtually nonexistent — families living in poverty have changed their vision of the future. More have acquired long-term goals, like educating their sons and daughters, saving and taking microloans to start new businesses, and building and maintaining more sanitary living spaces. Many outsiders think only of calamity when they hear the word Bangladesh — of factory fires, cyclones, floods and poverty. But the true Bangladesh is also the birthplace of microfinance and home to a robust civil society. It has seen rapid gains in living standards: maternal mortality is one-quarter of what it was in 1990; early childhood mortality is one-fifth of what it was in 1980, and we have eliminated the gender gap in primary and secondary school enrollment. These remarkable gains will mean little if we allow tragedies like the one at Savar to continue. The law must work for everyone, rich and poor, landless labourer and factory owner alike. We must not allow those who benefit from the exploitation of the vulnerable to continue to treat life so cheaply. What, then, is the solution? The changes must come first from Bangladesh itself. My country will require new political will to hold accountable those who willingly put human lives at such grave risk. It will also require the support of factory owners; civil society organizations, including my own; and the private sector, including Western buyers. The solutions start with the workers themselves; they must be allowed by their employers to unionise, so they can engage in collective bargaining and hold their employers responsible for basic standards of pay and safety. Their organized power is the only thing that can stand up to the otherwise unaccountable nexus of business owners and politicians, who are often one and the same. Western buyers, instead of squeezing factory owners on price, should finance better safety standards. The point needs to be made in the marketplace overseas that safety improvements are not so expensive that they can be used as an excuse for raising prices to the consumer. And consumers who are shocked by the working conditions need to realise that a playing field where the price tag is the only standard for a purchase is not a level one when workers’ lives are at stake. At the same time, the owners themselves cannot be let off the hook, for there is no excuse for criminal negligence. But they cannot be trusted to voluntarily do all that they might. In a country with 100,000 factories in and near the capital, and three million workers in its garment industry, an inspection force numbering 18 people only invites unconscionable lapses on the part of unscrupulous employers. The inspection force must be increased drastically, and it must vigorously enforce safety standards. The government, finally, must stop neglecting worker safety issues, even as it steps up enforcement. But that will be extremely difficult to accomplish as long as there is an unholy web of employers and politicians colluding to avoid responsibility for criminal negligence; that, in the end, is what trapped thousands of workers in the flimsy factory building that collapsed on them in Savar. Those workers cannot be forgotten until these issues are resolved. “Made in Bangladesh” should be a mark of pride, not shame. Bangladeshi civil society stands ready to work with the authorities to make this so. In the 1970s, during the early years of my country’s nationhood, Bangladesh was suffused with the energy of the struggle for independence, a yearning for freedom from exploitation. From this energy came microfinance, community health work, and other social innovations that, combined with new economic opportunities in export industries like textiles, have transformed the lives of tens of millions of poor people, particularly women. Today I grieve with my fellow countrymen, but I also raise my voice to say that this must not continue. As we mourn our losses, let us rekindle that spirit of liberation.

The website also said that they took a \"list of lists\" approach, consulting the authoritative rankings for a given industry and substituting judgment where quantitative assessments do not exist.

Muhith, who met his Indian counterpart P Chidambaram on Thursday, said he had first proposed it at a Saarc meeting in 1998 in Karachi, but it did not find acceptance. \"I proposed it again about two years ago, and a Saarc committee was set up...but nothing beyond that. We need not make it a Saarc currency. It can be sub-regional to start with...for those willing to join in,\" he said. \"We trade a lot among ourselves...It would be good to have a common currency. This will reduce the cost of doing business and ease trade and investment flows between neighbours,\" said the minister. Bangladesh and India will increase the number of land ports through which the two countries could trade, he said, but Bangladesh needs to build up its infrastructure before more facilities could be provided to businesses to trade through each other's territories. Both countries need to take steps to increase the number of border haats (market) to facilitate people-to-people commerce between the two nations, Muhith said. He said the government is working to develop infrastructure on the Ashuganj- Agortala railroad and waterway under India's credit line. Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Atiur Rahman also spoke at the same programme, and urged Indian entrepreneurs to invest in Bangladesh, saying that Bangladesh's FDI policy regime is among the most liberal in South Asia. He also highlighted the fast pace of Bangladesh's economic growth and improvements in its human development indices. Post tax profits/dividends of foreign investments are freely repatriable in foreign exchange, as are disinvestment proceeds including capital gains. He said occasional tax holidays allowed by the government for investments in various priority sectors apply equally for both domestic and foreign investments. As of now, earnings from IT services are exempt from income tax until June 2015, he added. \"Both Bangladesh Bank and the government remain responsive in promptly addressing new issues as they arise,\" said Atiur Rahman. Others who spoke at the meeting were Shekhar Dutta, past president of CII, who identified key areas where Indian and Bangladeshi businesses could collaborate, including IT and the knowledge economy.

    "title": "National pride more important than saving lives?",
    "body": "It is reported that the Bangladesh government chose not to accept offers of search and rescue teams from Britain and other countries to free people trapped in the collapsed Rana Plaza at Savar. Reporterdly, it was feared that accepting aid would damage national pride. Both the UK government and the United Nations said they had teams of experts ready to head out to Bangladesh but their offer of help was turned down. The home minister of Bangladesh defended the decision of the government as they “were confident we could manage it ourselves.” He further said: “We did a good job and I am proud of my people - the firemen, the military, the police, the local volunteers who all came in to help.” By May 3, around 2,400 people were rescued alive and 442 dead bodies were recovered from beneath the collapsed eight-storey building. Though untrained and ill-equipped, the volunteers, the army, the firefighters and the police did a remarkable job in making the rescue operation as effective as it was. Our hats are off to those who worked day and night, often without proper gear, taking great personal risks. Even so, despite how people of the country rose to the occasion, what was wrong in accepting foreign help for the rescue operation? The search and rescue teams of the UK and the US have vast experience in similar operations, particularly in earthquake-stricken areas. They have trained personnel and specialized equipment to locate and rescue victims from beneath debris. Both the foreign and local teams could take part in the rescue operation together. With the participation of skilled professionals, we could perhaps have saved far more lives - including victims like Shaheena who, unfortunately, succumbed to death waiting for over 100 hours to be rescued. She died, in the course of being rescued, because of a fire resulting from cutting of an iron rod with a gas flame. Moreover, getting assistance would also provide good training and a unique experience for our volunteers so that they could work with skilled experts and improve their own skills significantly. It is difficult to understand how our national pride could be damaged by accepting foreign assistance in rescuing people from a collapsed building. Turkey accepted foreign assistance after the earthquakes of 1999 and 2011. Even Japan, an economic superpower, did not hesitate to accept foreign assistance after the devastating tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear accident of 2011. Do we not damage our pride by exposing our garment, textile and other industry workers to the hazards of fires and collapsed buildings every now and then? Are we proud that we have one of the highest rates of road fatalities (6,300 per 100,000 vehicles/year), occupational fatality rates (26.4 per 100,000 employees/year) and occupational non-fatal accidents rates (20,132 per 100,000 employees/year) in the world? Let us not be too sensitive about our pride for the wrong reasons. There is absolutely nothing wrong in accepting aid during a disaster like the collapse of a building with about 4,000 people inside. We saved over 2,500 lives. What was wrong with trying to save more? After all, national pride cannot be more important than saving lives of victims of calamities.  Dr Abdul Matin is a former chief engineer of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission.",

    "body": "Utter confusion. Panic everywhere. I looked around and found a sea of unknown faces. People are either running around frantically filling up forms or rushing to nearby beds with rolled-up sleeves. The motive? To donate blood for the thousands of victims of the recent tragedy at Savar. It’s amazing how a national crisis can do wonders to unite a nation. There’s a popular saying that in times of great crises, a family really comes together. We all know about the recent eight-storey building collapse in Savar that left hundreds dead, thousands injured and millions devastated. But, having the privilege to witness some of the positive proceedings in the immediate aftermath, I am hopeful that a sense of camaraderie in times of such difficulty will help us further rise as a nation. Referring back to the scene at the hospital, I was impressed with the presence of a large young population at the gathering. Most of them also looked as if they belonged to the society’s upper-middle class. In contrast, the vast majority of victims turned out to be blue collar workers. The contrast couldn’t have been any more stark, could it? Despite all odds, the spirit that rose through the air, the invisible connection between hearts from worlds apart and the sheer aura of resilience among the denizens of Bangladesh stood out. It spread beyond all complexities and soared higher, leaving out greater disparities. While conventional wisdom and traditional thinking espouse looking up to the government to take measures, the current generation is wise enough to see past that. Seriously, what has the political clout resulted in other than issuing irresponsible comments from people in high-held positions? Sorry folks, but bringing the age-old blame game drama without even flinching for a second to acknowledge your own responsibilities in the mess doesn’t cut it any more. Enough is enough. So, what can we as responsible citizens do? Well, we don’t have to look too far to learn about the answers. A quick glance at my facebook newsfeed attests how proactive the present generation is. Youth organisations, voluntary groups, community organizations are all coming forward to play their part in a bid to mitigate the loss of lives and to alleviate suffering. Even many business organisations are actively driving blood donation initiatives and organizing the collection of dry food, water, supplies - anything to save lives under the circumstances - for the greater interest of the nation. It doesn’t stop there. There are many others who are straight away going to Savar to find more direct ways to contribute . Such selfless gestures, risking lives and sacrificing personal gains, speak volumes about the individuals who have stepped up to create this new historical chapter. A moment to behold. A legacy to follow. With incessant shrills of a thousand cries filling the heavy air of Savar and tormenting our conscience at this point, our hearts can only find solace when we know that there are millions of others who are playing a role to stop those cries. Contextually speaking, only relentless efforts of our present-day generation can bring about that peace. May Allah help us. Ivdad Ahmed Khan Mojlish is Managing Director, LightCastle Partners.",

    "body": "After last week’s horrendous incident in Savar, everyone is looking for someone to blame, and following the past week’s reporting, it seems as if there are two main groups; those who want to see Sohel Rana and his politician party buddies pinned to the wall, and those who blame the garment industry and its buyers, looking to boycott the entire industry and encouraging friends to change their Facebook profile pictures to blood-stained garments. Boycotting the garment buyers is not the solution to the core problem. It would merely be pushing the problem forward and letting it turn into something else. The problem is in the way Bangladesh is run; corruption and a lack of transparency that dilutes the will and effort of those who actually are prepared to give and share their wealth in order to support the overall growth and the well-being of the country. Stories of Bangladeshi suppliers whose factories are run in accordance to international sustainability standards, whose factories provide a decent job, health care and in some cases education and child care for the employee’s families - those stories are never run and those examples are never given. But these factories do exist and one could only wish for them to become role models and set an example for others. All of this does exist and is possible - even in Bangladesh. That said, buyers must act as role models too and set examples of what relationships they choose to enter with suppliers. Without a doubt, buyers have taken advantage of Bangladesh and its cheap labour; making lucrative deals with suppliers and being able to produce cheap garments sold to Westerners. Thanks to past decades, increased media attention to sweat shops, child labour, inhumane working environments etc, end-buyers (you and me), have become more aware and begun to question multinationals and their methods of production. Today you will not find an international garment producing company without a sustainability and corporate responsibility department as part of their organisation, receiving more and more attention every year. This said, buyers are nowhere near where they aim or need to be. Nowhere near what is stated in the oh-so-often eloquently written sustainability goals. Why? Well, this is the tricky bit: the power of how things are managed in Bangladesh is not in the buyers’ hands. The garment industry has become so powerful and in such demand that if even the biggest buyers would reject a supplier - that supplier would simply turn to a smaller buyer that isn’t as scrutinising as a large one. Is it then the buyer’s fault or the supplier who simply doesn’t care at what price (human lives) s/he sells his services? Buyers cooperating, worker’s unions (which many buyers include as part of their sustainability standards), can together push and encourage suppliers to improve the working standards for their employees. By no means should this mean that suppliers are pushed to the limit of bankruptcy - Bangladeshi garment factory owners are amongst the wealthiest in the country and can surely spare some of their profit margin on securing infrastructure and fire safety in their factories. The buyers certainly secure that for their own employees in Bangladesh - where you will also find their employees paying Bangladeshi tax, contributing to the country’s wealth. Perhaps if the wealthiest people in Bangladesh would start paying tax as well, and if the government would have a trustworthy way of distributing this wealth in a fair way to its people - perhaps then, heart breaking incidents like the one in Savar could be avoided in the future. Perhaps then, the situation and current direction Bangladesh is heading could change. Not one person, not one buyer or one party is to blame here, everyone shares a part in taking responsibility. However, ultimately it is up to Bangladesh to set and live by its own standards and ensure that everybody that wants to invest in the country abides by those rules.

    "title": "Where change ultimately comes from",
    "body": "Whenever a crisis strikes our nation, Bangladeshis from all walks of life join hands to help those who have fallen. However, after the crisis is resolved, we seldom learn our lessons from these crises. A culmination of factors led to the tragedy – the addition of four floors on a structure with a permit for five storeys, an inherent structural fault due to the building’s sub-standard foundation and factories operating in a non-industrialised building, amongst others. The question that needs to be asked is who should be really held accountable for the death of these people – the government, factory owners, building owner, western retailers or the consumers of these products? It is the government’s first and foremost responsibility to ensure the safety of its people. The RMG sector accounts for almost 75-80% of the country’s exports and about 13% of its GDP. It is the RMG exports and foreign remittance from Bangladeshi workers abroad which has enabled us to build a surplus of foreign reserves and achieve an annual GDP growth of about 6% over the last decade. From an economic perspective a potential cut-back in garment imports from the country would devastate the economy. Hence, it is of utmost importance that the government starts reviewing the safety standards of all industrial facilities and working with the international community to enforce a more rigorous monitoring system to ensure compliance. The lives of 55-plus innocent low-income people should not and cannot be written off as an acceptable loss. The RMG industry is a low margin business; the only way to make profit is produce enough to make up for the low margin. Hence, it is often difficult for the local factory owners to enforce international worker safety standards, as they require some investment. In essence, the real power lies with western brands and retailers, beginning with the biggest players: Wal-Mart, H & M, Inditex, Gap and others. These big brands and retailers need to understand and learn from the “Nike” experience. Western brands and retailers, in collaboration with the suppliers, need to develop a code of ethics and best practices. While many of these retailers already have them in place and regular audits are conducted, these code of ethics are not practiced throughout the organisation. A corporate social responsibility program can have some influence, but in order to be properly implemented it needs to have a buy-in from all the suppliers. The global retailers need to understand that they just simply cannot issue a supplier code of conduct and perform regular audits. Audits are part of the solution but simply not the answer. Change does not happen instantaneously, rather it needs to be managed. The first step would be to investigate the entire supply chain and identify areas that need improvement. These improvements then need to be monitored in such a way, so that they become part of the supplier’s culture. If they are monitored from the outside, it will be a “one-day” thing, during which the firm follows the best practices just to pass the audit. It’s essential that these best practices become an integral part of the culture. The suppliers and factory owners need to understand that increases in productivity can be achieved through improvement in working conditions, thereby leading to higher efficiency and profits. Factory owners need to look beyond the numbers and build links between the human element and traditional areas of measurement such as quality and delivery. A clear business case needs to be made for investment in human resource management systems. Without a buy-in from all the stakeholders, corporate social responsibility cannot be integrated as part of a company’s day-to-day operations. The Nike fiasco in the 1990s can serve as a great role model. For example, excessive overtime had been a problem in a lot of Nike contracted factories. Nike commissioned extensive research and found that the reasons for excessively long work hours among its suppliers were poor application of local laws, flawed factory management approaches and upstream business processes that caused extra work. Best practice research shows links between long hours, increased accidents and poor health, but plant managers need specific data from their own facilities showing when defects, accidents and even needle breakages occur. For example, do workers break more needles at the end of their shifts than at the beginning, or during long periods of frequent overtime? If so, it may mean they’re tired and not paying as much attention to their work and quality suffers. On top of that, potentially productive time is wasted when changing needles. McKinsey in its 2011 report about the RMG sector in Bangladesh correctly mentions that the contracted factories are a long way from following the international standards of work place safety. The government and factory owners need to understand that investment in human capital will come back as higher productivity gains. This kind of an investment will generate high long-term returns in terms of higher profits and increased business for the RMG sector. Finally, consumers of these products need to realise that they are the ones who hold the ultimate power to see these injustices to an end. They did it with child labour in Nike-contracted factories in the 1990s. Consumers are smart enough to draw a line with what is right and wrong. Consumers need to inhibit purchasing from retailers who cannot ensure that their products were manufactured under the international standards of compliance. Only then the Western brands and retailers will take compliance seriously. Consumers need to realise that they are actively taking part in blood fashion. Kids have lost parents in the tragedy and this blood is on the hands of the end consumers. Azfar Hossain is a freelance contributor.",

    "title": "VSPs idle for five weeks",
    "body": "The country’s newly enacted VoIP Service Providers (VSPs) are still unable to deliver its services though more than five weeks have elapsed since the licences were granted. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), starting from March 25, distributed the 841 VSP licences but none of the operators could yet come to agreement with anyone to route their voice calls as no directives have been given to the International Gateways (IGWs). VSP licensees claimed that they approached all 29 IGW operators but none could provide any solution. Nor did they have the knowledge of when the VSPs will be allowed to avail the services. They also claimed that BTRC is showing negligence regarding the issues. “The IGW operators are not providing the VSPs connectivity because according to them, they have not been given any directives from the concerned authorities,” Muazzem Hossain, convener of Bangladesh Association of VoIP Services Provider (BAVSP) told the Dhaka Tribune. He said: “BTRC is now trying to make a guideline about the issue, which is what they should have done before. “We know the regulator have requested the IGWs for connectivity proposals, later to be revised by them [BTRC], but such a process is time consuming which is what we do not have.” Rabiul Hossen, owner of Venous Trading and the coordinator of BAVSP, said: “BTRC has done nothing for us yet, though we paid millions in licence fees. Even after obtaining the licence, we still have to sit idle.” However, ATM Monirul Alam, commissioner of BTRC, said: “We have already identified the problems and had a discussion with the two parties. Now we are trying to make a guideline for both VSP and IGW operators.” High officials from the engineering and operation division informed that the BTRC have thought of attaching 30-35 VSP licensees under each IGW for connectivity. They said: “The huge number of VSP licensees is a major problem. If we had granted around 250 licences then both parties could have done business.” Sources also mentioned that it might take time for all the granted VSPs to become operational. Earlier, an evaluation committee also recommended that granting 250 licences would be a standard and at best, five hundred licences could be given thinking of the future. But the government approved more than a thousand licences. BAVSP, on this issue, has expressed their concern and raised a five-point demand. According to existing guidelines, VSP operators are entitled to receive 5% of the incoming revenue but BAVSP wants to increase it to 15%. They also demanded connectivity as early as possible. Ten years back, in 2003 a cabinet meeting approved of VoIP services but BTRC took time to issue the VSP licences. After finalising the guideline last year, they sought for applications from interested entrepreneurs. Some 1,508 applications were submitted within October. Later, BTRC evaluated the applications cleared 1,004 companies for the licence. BTRC distributed the licences to the organisations who paid the licence fee of Tk500,000 along with VAT and other related dues in February this year. They distributed licences to 841 organisations out of the approved 1,004 as the rest did not clear the fees.",

Volume of trade improved a bit in the 4-session week with the daily average turnover standing at Tk1.38bn — a slight rise of 2.57% over the previous week. \"The bourses ended the week lower due to mixed reaction of investors towards the quarterly and yearly announcements,\" stated LankaBangla Securities, in its weekly market analysis. Moreover, gloomy political and economic outlook has made the market more volatile during the week, said the stock broker. The week saw 49 points slump in response to the political unrest and a tragedy in Readymade Garment (RMG) sector due to Savar building collapse, it added. However, equilibrium trading in the following two days facilitated the market in consolidating until Tuesday and bouncing back sharply on Thursday thanks to the Prime Minister's offer for holding dialogue with the opposition BNP to end political crisis. \"Bearish tone prolonged in the week too with DSEX losing further 35.38 points. However, market showed a strong resilience with DGEN hovering around 3,600 as earnings and dividends revealed by companies, investors seemed stepping out of hibernation and acting over declarations,\" said IDLC Investments, in its weekly market analysis. “Textile sector continued bleeding over apparent gloomy outlook, culminated further over the aftermath of building collapse tragedy at Savar.

    "body": "The much-awaited auction for 3G mobile phone spectrum is likely to be held on July 30 this year as Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) informed the operators about their plan informally. A formal decision would be taken at the commission meeting scheduled for tomorrow, an official told the Dhaka Tribune on Saturday. The auction is being delayed by five weeks from the existing date on June 24, as a result. “As lots of unresolved issues between government and the operators remain pending, we’ll have to reschedule the date,” a high official of BTRC said, requesting anonymity. BTRC Chairman Sunil Kanti Bose hinted the officials about the new date before his leaving for abroad last week. Robi Executive Vice President Mahmudur Rahman said that BTRC has already informed them about the changed schedule. “We are preparing ourselves for the new auction date.” The BTRC chairman also attended a meeting with the chief executives of the mobile phone operators at his office on April 25 when he proposed the change in the auction schedule for the first time, said an official. Another official said the BTRC will have to consult with the Finance Minister about the fees before rescheduling the auction. At the same time, BTRC will have to extend the deadline for submission of applications by a minimum of two weeks from May 12. They as well need to re-fix the date of publishing the name of eligible firms, which was earlier scheduled on May 20. And the date for depositing earnest money of US$20m also needs to be extended. Earlier, BTRC had extended the tender submission deadline from April 12 to April 15. They also needed to reject all the five previous bids and went for appointing two individuals as consultants for conducting the 3G auction management. The appointment of consultants has not been completed yet. According to the guidelines, the regulator will award three licenses to the bid winners from among five existing operators and a new one. The state-run operator, Teletalk, has already got the 3G license by default. The tenure of the 3G license will be 15 years. The regulator will offer a 5-Megahertz (MHz) slot for spectrum in 2100 band, the floor price of per Mega Hertz spectrum has been fixed at US$20m. According to the guideline, 60% of the total price of spectrum assignment has to be paid in the first installment within 60 days of auction and the remaining 40% in the second installment by 180 days.",

    "title": "There will be blood",
    "body": "Every country in the world, rich or poor, dreams of striking big reserves of oil. Why shouldn't they? Striking oil is equivalent to winning the lottery prize. Your country gets an abundant source of liquid cash flow for decades, a cash flow that doesn't require much hard work or intelligent planning. But, as many studies have shown that in most of the cases, winning a lottery makes the typical lotto winner more miserable and unhealthy in the long term, striking big oil can also be very detrimental to the health of the nation in the long haul. In economics, a concept called “resource curse” has become very popular in recent decades. In general terms, resource curse means that when a country starts utilising a cheap and abundant natural resource, the strength of its economy become overly reliant on that resource, other sectors of the economies get neglected, government becomes dependent on the revenue from natural resource, and the country’s overall development suffers. Resource curse does not occur in underdeveloped countries only, it can happen in rich-industrialised nations too. The most famous example is the “Dutch Disease’” that occurred in the Netherlands in the 1960s and 70s. Holland almost overnight became an oil exporting nation when North Sea oil reserves were discovered in the early 60s. Holland was and still is one of the most advanced industrialised economies of the world. But when it struck oil, its economy became imbalanced. The overnight riches from oil revenue pushed the general labour wages very high. The high labour cost made its manufacturing sector uncompetitive compared to close rivals like West Germany, France, etc. Within a few years the famous Dutch manufacturing sector rapidly shrunk to become a shadow of its previous self. But it is upon the poorer and more under-developed countries that the curse of easy resources wreaks the full havoc. To understand the mechanics of the curse, we have to understand some very basics of political economy. All governments, be they autocratic or representative, are somewhat accountable to the people. At the bare minimum they must feed the people, provide basic amenities and maintain the rudimentary structure of the state. If governments fail to do that, the people will rise up and sweep away the regime. Moreover, even if the government is exploitative and extortionist, it wants to maintain a running economy, otherwise there will be no wealth to extract from the people. A prudent government therefore devotes lot of attention to economic growth because not only economic growth means a satisfied people; it also means more wealth to extract. But when a country strikes abundant natural resources, the government gets an easy source of wealth without being responsible for a healthy economy. The cash flow from resource export balances the budget, provides the wealth to maintain a police state, enables government to bribe the community leaders and keep the extortionist machinery going. The government does not feel the need to develop a robust and diversified indigenous economy. The government also does not feel pressure to reform representative politics, as they can effectively buy people's silence by bribery or threat. Moreover, the flow of unaccountable wealth generates lot of venality in the politics and society. Thus underdeveloped countries that struck oil often become poorly-governed and unrepresentative of the common people. From Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria to the typical countries in the Middle East, we can see the resource curse working to the detriment of the people. Bangladesh’s abundant resource Of course Bangladesh has not struck oil and our vaunted natural gas reserve is actually rather puny compared to the world (.001%). We also do not have other natural resources for big time export. But the idea that Bangladesh has indeed struck big oil came into my mind a few years ago. I thought that Bangladesh found oil in the form of abundant and inexhaustible source of cheap labour from its people. For more than two decades, the Bangladesh economy has been standing on the twin pillars of garments export and foreign remittances. In general, a country is deemed resource dependent when 70 to 90% of its foreign exchange income is derived from just one or two natural resources. Let us now dive into some statistics to see how over reliant we have become upon our main natural resource, our abundance of people. Bangladesh has been experiencing tremendous export growth over the last two decades. From 2002 to 2007, the volume of exports nearly doubled. From 2007 to 2012 the volume more than doubled again and in 2012 we exported more than $24 billion worth of goods and services. This statistic should be a source of unalloyed pride but the composition of exports throws some cold water on the joy. Garments exports have rapidly grown from 53% of total exports in 1995 to almost 80% today. Bangladesh's exports in 2012 were $24.3 billion, of which garments contributed $19 billion. This close to 80% mark should be a very sobering indicator of a very unbalanced economy. There are now over 5,000 garments factories employing over 4 million people, of which 80% are female. The primary determinant of sourcing for international garments business is still cheap labour. Labour costs are still major determinant of competitiveness in labour-intensive global garments production and trade. What is remarkable is that even among other poor and low cost garments exporting countries; Bangladesh boasts a great advantage in labour costs. The advantage becomes starker when we compare it with other developing economies. Even when we compare with our national bugaboo India, we see a very dramatic contrast. Labour costs in Bangladesh are almost one-third of those in India. The average monthly labour cost in India is over Rs.7,000 per person, while it less than Tk4,000 in Bangladesh. Moreover Indians firms have to pay 9.6 percent export duty to export to European markets while Bangladesh, which is categorised as a least developed country (LDC), enjoys duty-free access. Contrary to all protestations, cheap labour is indeed the great comparative advantage of Bangladesh garments sector; the “killer app” of our exporting prowess. Now let us look into the other pillar of Bangladesh's external income, foreign remittance. Our foreign remittance income has really taken off, particularly in the last 10 years. With $14 billion of remittance income, Bangladesh is now the 8th largest recipient of external remittance income. If we look into the source of remittance income we can see that although US and Europe have become growing sources of income in the recent years, the bulk of our foreign remittance still come from Saudi Arabia, the Gulf countries and countries in East Asia. Nearly 70% of our remittances come from these countries alone. Bangladesh's explosive growth in foreign remittances is mainly comprised of semi-skilled and unskilled workers who accounted for 80% of the foreign workforce in 2007. The percentage of professional workers were less than 1% while skilled labourers accounted for 19%. As in the RMG sector, the main advantage of our overseas labour force seem to be readiness to work very hard for very little money. So how big is the contribution of remittances to the economy of Bangladesh? In 2008 remittances were 9% of overall GDP and almost 60% of total exports. This contribution has been increasing rapidly over the last decade. For example in 2011 our GDP was $111 billion and remittances were $12 billion, the ration is still above 10% and in 2012 it has only become greater as remittance income touched nearly $14 billion. But is this out of place? How do we compare with other remittance earning countries? Among similar economies, only Nepal has a larger remittance to GDP ratio. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Indonesia all these rival economies have much less dependency on remittances. Remittance is the only thing that is standing between sustainability and quick bankruptcy of our economy. Although we have experience impressive export growth, our import growth has been more spectacular. In 2010-11 the gap between imports and exports was nearly $8 billion. If it weren't for the $10 billion-plus of remittances, our balance of payments would have a massive and unplug-able hole in the middle. Thus far we have seen that RMG export and remittances have affected the country's finances like an abundant source of natural resource, dwarfing other economic activities and shoring up the finances of the country. But there is a difference between income from natural resources and income from people. Resources income mostly directly goes to the government and then how it is used depends completely upon the system of governance. But our people's income from RMG and remittances mostly goes to people directly and is therefore changing the economy irrespective of the government. The most positive aspect of RMG and remittances is that common poor people have a large share in it. In economics in is well understood that a unit of income in the hands of the poor has a much bigger multiplier effect for the economy than the same unit of income in the hands of the rich. Poor people spend the bulk of their income on basic necessities which tend to recirculate the money in the domestic economy. Remittance income now accounts for 13% of household income for the poor and lower-income people. There is no doubt contribution of RMG sector will be at a similar level. A study found that almost a quarter of poverty decline between 2000 and 2005 in Bangladesh can be attributed to the combined impacts of remittances and RMG export. Since income from the two sources only accelerated from 2005 onwards, it is safe to assume their role in poverty reduction has only grown. While the torrents of cash flow from RMG exports and foreign remittances were boosting the economy of Bangladesh, they were also creating problems that are very similar to resource curse. With RMG exports and foreign remittances doing a lot of the heavy lifting for economic growth, wealth dispersion and poverty alleviation, the governments since the early 2000s have felt little urgency to reform the economy, implement regulations, and develop the human capital of the country. Actually, these engines of economic growth took care of the country's finances to such an extent that it freed the governments from worrying much about economic development at all. Every year revenue collection kept rising because of increasing consumption of the common people. The governments ceased to worry about governance at all since these two sources went on delivering economic dividends without much tinkering from the top. The governments have not been using their new freedom and ready cash bonanza wisely. Nothing makes the sorry performance of governments in the last 12 years starker than the state of infrastructure in Bangladesh. Infrastructure investment Those of us who have experience traveling abroad know that in the decade of 2000-10, Asia transformed itself from underdeveloped third world to world-beating top class infrastructure leader. Many economists credit Asian infrastructure spending as one of the key drivers of Asian economic growth. Currently India is spending about 4.7% of GDP on infrastructure while China is splurging 8.5% of GDP in annual infrastructure development. Throughout 2000-10 Bangladesh's infrastructure spending remained below 2%. In fact from 2000 to 2007 there was actually declining trend in allocation for infrastructure. Lack of infrastructure spending and lack of regulation now have made Dhaka the worst city in the world and the whole country is on the way to become world's largest semi-urban slum. Government apathy is the least of our problems now. Unprecedented cash flow from the RMG exports and remittances have helped transform the political organisations of the parties into full-fledged extraction rackets. From lowly political cadres at the streets to MPs, ministers and head of the government at the top, the extraction pyramid has become so lucrative that holding power of the state has become a higher stake than ever. We get a picture of the fantastic amount of money sloshing around when a few of the scandals, which are but the tip of the iceberg, gets reveals before a dazed public. Freed from concerns of economic development, the leaders of the governments in the last two elected regimes devoted most of their time in scheming to do what they always wanted, annihilation of the opposition. Inherent lack of check and balances in our democratic system and our pervasive lack of democratic ethos meant that we always had governments that ruled like autocracy. The two external sources of income have reduced economic accountability thus further exacerbating the problem of governance. Businessmen everywhere hate regulations. They think regulations only make them less profitable and competitive. They think they can police themselves and government interference is unnecessary. We must understand that in Bangladesh the government itself is incentivised to regulate the golden egg laying RMG and manpower export sector as little as possible. Government is performing the role of patron and protector of the export oligarchy. Not only the ruling party but even the opposition largely sings from the same hymn sheet. Even the middle class have become addicted to the easy money from RMG and remittances. We know that the consumption boom that is fueling the commercial sector, the salary inflation that is making the corporate sector so lucrative, the property bubble that is creating thousands of millionaires, the money transfers that is enabling us to get second citizenships and second homes, all these have been made possible to a large extent by the growth in these two sectors. Nowadays, export and remittance growth have become the most eagerly anticipated economic indicators in the country. Our think tanks and policy makers unabashedly discuss how we can send yet more people abroad to increase the flow of money. We feel pride in the fact that India with a population of 1,200 million has only 12 million emigrants abroad while Bangladesh with 150 million has sent nearly 5.5 million of its children abroad. We feel no shame that we are failing to create opportunities at home and emptying our country of most of the enterprising people. High profit, high risk, lack of regulation and lack of implementing authority always create a mad scramble for profit. In the US, from mid-19th century to early 20th century, there were several petroleum oil booms. Successively oil was discovered in Pennsylvania, Texas and then in California. This was the period when petroleum was fast becoming an essential household and industrial commodity. Since petroleum was never extracted before, these new oil wells were easy to extract. If you were lucky, you just dig a few feet and black gold gushed forth. There were several mad scrambles to make easy money from oil wells. People with little or no experience went on buy extraction rights and operate oil rigs. Prospecting for oil and operating rigs were very risky but at the same time wildly profitable if luck clicked. At the same time America was still a frontier country, therefore regulations and authority were minimal. There were plenty of intrigue, deceit, murders, and accidents. The very excellent film “There Will Be Blood (2007)” shows some of the ruthless and gung-ho nature of the oil business in the early days. High risk, high profit and lack of regulation also characterise our RMG export sector. We can also see a mad scrambling to make quick money. Like remittances, the entire money-making edifice of RMG stands on the fact that we have a huge supply of desperately poor workers who are willing to work in the worst environment for the least amount of money. Therefore there is also no shortage of fly by night entrepreneurs who jump in with a ramshackle setup to make a lot of money in a very little time. The same basic features also ensure that we see a steady stream of deaths from factory fire and collapse, deaths in inhuman working conditions in the Middle East, deaths in desert and sea among people who risk everything to go someplace better. We are building a Shining Bangladesh on the bones of the wretched poor. Nobody asks unpleasant questions about the actual contribution of the educated middle class in building this new economy. This is not a path unique to Bangladesh. Lot of countries went through a similar phase in their economic development. China’s unprecedented rush to industrial superpower-hood left behind hundreds of thousands of deaths from factory-mining accidents and a ruined environment. In China too, the government and business operated in tandem just like the fascist fusion of corporate and government. But the Chinese government and many other newly developed Asian governments were also single-minded about developing the economy and moving up the economic value chain. They quickly invested most of their gains from cheap labour into developing the human and country capability to prepare for the next economic level. Many of the developing nations have had rapid income growth on the basis of RMG export but as their economies developed and income reached certain level, their garments industry became non-competitive and business moved to a different country. Bangladesh has still a long way to go before we reach that level of income. So in the near future the RMG export sector has little fear of being priced out of competition. But we have everything to fear from temporary sanctions from buying countries or companies because of the globally publicised mega-accidents. Our over-reliance on RMG sector have made us very vulnerable even to temporary shocks. Shafiqur Rahman is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at a US university.

    "body": "To be, or not to be, that is the question, the famous opening phrase of a monologue in William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The protagonist, Prince Hamlet asks himself whether he should continue to live or not? Similarly, after the recent Savar Rana Plaza tragedy, the question is being asked as to whether or not the garment industry should remain in Bangladesh After such a catastrophic incident, with emotions running high, many of us have fast concluded that the garments industry in Bangladesh should be abolished. Some people don’t think that is necessary as the industry will self-destruct soon enough, just like the jute industry, that once produced our “golden fibre.” However, I personally believe that abolishing the garment industry, on account of poor working conditions and benefits for the workers, is equivalent to cutting off your head from the neck up because of a sore throat. The garment industry and the remittance industry (where poor, unskilled Bangladeshi workers from all over the world send money back home) bring home, by far, the largest share of foreign currency to our country, which is essential for the nation’s economy. The garment industry, like all industries, has its share of problems, problems that need to be addressed. No industry in Bangladesh is perfect. It is just a question of scale. If the processed food industry in our country was nearly as big as the RMG industry, the problems in it would have been more prominent in that field: it’s simple math! So, just like you wouldn’t cut off your right hand because of a localised rash, we should not, cut off a hand and let this industry die a slow death. We should find the root problems behind the incidents like the Rana Plaza collapse, the Tazreen Garments fire, and incidents of the sort. I believe that the practice of rampant corruption, much like it has negatively contributed to many other fields, is to blame. Some building inspector allowed Rana Plaza to be built in spite of its faults. The building has only drawn attention due to the recent incident. Other buildings, hundreds and thousands of them, all over Bangladesh do not meet the required building codes and are hence susceptible to such mishaps. Whoever allowed these buildings to be built, without meeting requirements, are to be blamed. These people have engaged in corruption, whether or not money changed hands, for not doing their work properly, and hence should be severely punished. As should be evident by now, I insist that the garment industry, which practically runs the country, must stay. Do not punish it for a sin it has not committed; please do not let it die a slow death. For God’s sake, please don’t! Mahdin Mahboob teaches Engineering at ULAB.",

    "body": "As forethought to the people killed in Savar, consider this: in Bangladesh, almost 30 people are killed every day on the road. This amounts to 11,000 deaths every year. Unbelievable? Xinhua will testify to the accuracy of the number. Consider how many people are murdered in various crimes – police report the count at 3,988 in 2010 alone. Between 2005 and 2010, the count exceeds 23,000. Police reports often underestimate the numbers and Bangladesh police websites only have data up to 2010. From 2009 to 2011, about 200 people have been killed in extrajudicial killings by Rab. In 2013 alone, a reported 100 or more have been killed in political unrest and 800 others injured. A week ago, the Rana Plaza collapse killed more than 400 people, with scores still missing. It would be a lie to say there were no signs. Five years ago there was the Spectrum disaster; in 2010, there was a fire at Garib & Garib Sweater Limited. Six months ago, Tazreen Fashions was wilfully set on fire and more than 100 workers were burnt alive according to a BGMEA report. This latest cannot be considered as an isolated incident in the context of Bangladesh. Accidents are waiting to happen – one after another after another. Worse still, many of these events seem designed and intended. We can no longer escape the facts by simply calling them accidents. There has been significant global interest in the Rana Plaza collapse, and rightly so. The finger invariably is pointed to the readymade garment industry that accounts for a little under 80% of Bangladesh’s export volume. This is a reflexive action. The connections between people getting killed in a building collapse and people getting killed in road accidents or criminal activities or political unrest is admittedly far-fetched. The fact of the matter, however, is that these are unnatural deaths that should not occur, can be avoided, and have the same root cause. For argument’s sake, suppose, I know someone with high connections in the government. My neighbour is not as well connected as I am. I know that I can grab his land forcefully, and cut out a share for my political connection, who will make necessary arrangements for me to get away with this crime. If opposed, I will simply kill my neighbour and use my influence to pay off the law who will keep silent about the matter. Since I have the land now, what do I do with it? A barren slice of gravel offers no advantages. So, I decide to erect an establishment on the plot. On the base, a supermarket, over it an office or production space. Now, to reduce costs and taxes I get permission for a 5-storeyed building. I raise a 10-storeyed building instead, using the cheapest materials I can find and use my influence to silence the regulatory bodies, if any. If need be, I make necessary financial contributions to keep the regulators happy. Now, this building, defective ab-initio, will fall under its own weight. It is a matter of when, rather than if. When it does collapse, the fate of all the people inside the building is connected to me and my misdeeds. It is a domino effect that had been initiated long before the building actually collapsed. When the building falls, the finger is initially pointed at me, and afterwards, at the authorities. The authorities will then start a game of musical chairs. Ultimately, it’s nobody’s baby. Then again, every person and position involved in this vicious chain is actually responsible – except probably the actual owner of the land, who was powerless to defend his territory and was forced to keep silent. Seems familiar? It is. And this analogy is not only restricted to Sohel Rana, his ill-fated building and the innocent people who have lost their lives in the tragedy. There are several Rana Plazas waiting for their moment of doom. Rana Plaza is a representation of the culture of the right of might and money that rules Bangladesh, and is the root cause of most national problems. It is easy to make Sohel Rana a scapegoat, point fingers at the ever-so-greedy factory owners who build their fortunes exploiting the lives and misfortune of the poor. Undoubtedly, along with Rana, all the owners who risk the lives and safety of their workers are culpable. Then again, the people who create this chain of corruption and deceit are at least equally, if not more, culpable. Rana served his own purposes. He was neither paid, nor bound to think about social welfare or employee security. The government, with its legislative, executive and judicial branches are assigned, elected and paid to take care of civic and human rights. Why did they turn a blind eye? Only time will tell if they will continue to ignore the wake up calls as they have ignored the warnings that have come before. There is no point in singling out the current regime for criticism. This has been the unfortunate story, across regimes, of a country that is actually still ruled by a generation that literally fought for liberty. Putting things into perspective, the entire population of Bangladesh is actually responsible for the sustenance of this culture. It is the masses who either pay the bribes to get work done, or accept this wicked culture as a way of being. We have never collectively asked our government to do the right thing. We have always put ourselves first, gotten the job done by whatever means necessary and have not bothered to raise dissent as long as the happenings have not affected us directly. We have never stood up for our rights. Never have we asked the government to earn the taxes that people pay. We have made the government believe that the government exists to be served by us and not the other way around. Apparently, we never learn. Surprisingly, people have been talking about the image of Bangladesh in the aftermath of this major mass-killing. Yes, Rana Plaza is murder. The whole nation is responsible. In the end, Sohel Rana may be given a life sentence and pardoned by the president after 5 years. The engineers who failed to monitor whether the building was compliant or the engineers who certified it safe may escape with minimal punishment. Worse still, this case may stagnate like the murder of Bishwajit, or the Tazreen Fashions fire. Ultimately, nothing will happen. My fear is that every single taka that has ever been spent as bribe, every single favour that has been extended illegally, every time justice has been denied and delayed – all the courses of action that have contributed to the creation of the empire of no rule that we bow to – will come back to haunt us. Even if we don’t pay the price personally, people we care about will. Shahtab Mahmud is a journalist.",

    "title": "My religion is my own",
    "body": "When I first came to know of Hefazat-e-Islam and their 13-point demand – perhaps conservative stance on Islam bordering on ultra-conservatism might be more appropriate here – I immediately thought not only of the Taliban, but the Afghani film Osama. The protagonist, called Osama, is a 12-year old girl on the cusp of womanhood, raised by a single mother, who is a nurse, and her grandmother. Both Osama’s father and brother have passed away in previous Afghani wars. Once the Taliban take over and cut off funding to the hospital where Osama and her mother worked, the latter loses her job, and cannot get another. Bear in mind that, under Taliban rule, women were not allowed to go outside the house, unless accompanied by a male relative, impossible in this family’s case. With their sole income source cut off, the women resort to desperate means to ensure they can keep putting food on the table, but even then, fate is not on their side. I will refrain from giving away the rest of the plot, but it is an excellent portrayal of what happens to a single family when ultra-conservative ideas of Islam are applied. Watch the film and ask yourself: Is this what Hefazat wants to reduce us to? With the siege of Dhaka looming, I feel it is my duty to speak up, as a believer if you will, and a Muslim. Bear in mind, I’m no PhD-holding scholar of Islam, but I have been raised in a religious, conservative and educated family from a very young age. Moreover, I too have studied Islam and Islamic history over the span of many years, both in the Middle East, as well as at university in the United States. Now, I understand that many conservative Muslim families in our country are alarmed by the cultural changes they have seen, and feel that the traditional religious ways are being pushed aside. Hence, their overwhelming support for Hefazat, at least in rural areas. These families have a right to feel that concern, but here’s what they fail to see, and even disregard, about Islam. At its heart, Islam is a religion of peace, compassion, and privately held beliefs, where one leads by example. Islam is defined as submission to God, not to man, and a Muslim is, by definition, one who submits to God. The first, and most basic, tenet is about believing in God and God’s messenger, the Prophet (SM). There is, of course, also the extended one that includes belief in the angels, the books, the other prophets that came before Muhammad (SM), making him the last one. This is a privately held belief meant to establish a direct connection between the believer and God. One person or group forcing another to announce to the world that one is a Muslim does not make one a Muslim. Now, consider the second tenet, prayer. Whether people pray in a group, or individually, that prayer is done privately and directly to God, even if a religious leader is leading the prayer. The other three tenets follow the same example. The visit to Mecca is a private duty for each individual to fulfill. Except in dire circumstances, no one is exempt from this obligation. Fasting during the month of Ramadan, even if done with family and in a community, is, basically an individual act and promise, as is the giving of zakat. Therefore, Islam is a private, individual-based religion, in that sense. Also consider the word “jihad.” Many Western media have used this word to signify “Holy War,” when, by definition, jihad primarily means an internal spiritual struggle in the way of Allah, referring to the internal struggle that is one’s duty, as one decides between what is right and moral, and what is wrong. That is a private war as well. Many conservative Muslims and Hefazat as well – so it seems from their 13-point demand – are under the impression that Islam is universal, and they can compel others to believe in it as well, disregarding individual choice and consequences, disregarding the Sufi influence and the vast pre-Islamic history that has shaped this nation. Have they forgotten the history of Islam itself? Have they forgotten by what example the Prophet (SM) and the caliphs led their followers? The respect they held for both men and women as equals, as brothers and sisters? That seems to be the case. And, as for preventing a woman from working outside the home, not only is it impractical, but also it gives her no option to support her family, as the need arises, and dooms that family to hunger and poverty. Ask yourself if this is Islamic and something the Prophet (SM) and his followers would do. The Taliban didn’t understand this much, and, based on what Hefazat leaders have said so far, and their demands, they don’t understand this either. We have moved far away from the true essence of Islam, from the basic concepts of respect for all humanity, decency, courtesy, understanding, compassion, honesty and kindness. Some of these qualities I still find among many Muslims in our nation. Others, however, are severely lacking. All things considered, conservative Muslims should understand that no one is taking away their religion. They have a right to their beliefs. What they don’t have is the right to force those beliefs onto anyone who disagrees with them. In such a case, they would be taking away the religion of others, in a manner of speaking. In my case, during my study, I went back to the fundamentals and developed a deep and profound belief in God. Question me if you will, but I know that God exists. It is my privately held belief and I have enough respect for others to not impose it on them. It is their prerogative to believe as they will, and I expect the same courtesy in return. Sayeeda T.

They have even formed teams of volunteers ready to give their lives if need be. This reeks of absolute disrespect for the government and the public. Hefazat has shown an unwillingness to sit at the negotiation table and start a dialogue, whereas, the government has pursued every opportunity for dialogue and compromise. The thing is no one is standing in Hefazat’s way. No one has said they have no right to voice their concerns or to believe what they want to believe. But for Hefazat to tell anyone else what to do or believe is just wrong. And, for that matter, who gives them the right to besiege Dhaka and stop whoever they want from coming in and out of the city? No one. It is one thing to hold rallies, to assemble and demonstrate, but to threaten to besiege Dhaka and overthrow the government is little short of sedition. This is a democracy, and, in this democracy, Hefazat does have a voice, and a right to speak their minds. But to accompany their words with threats is unconscionable. We are willing to listen to them. We are willing to sit with them in dialogue and hear them out. But, they need to respect us as well. Unfortunately, their actions and their threats indicate their refusal to even do that much. It is one thing to say what one wants. It is quite another to impose oneself on another.

The recent moves from both major political parties should give the nation hope that leaders from both parties are amenable to finding a feasible solution to the political deadlock that has developed over the last few months. An end may actually be in sight. What is even more heartening is that this is not a result of one side or another caving in. Both sides seem willing to make concessions and the view from outside makes it seem like they may be able to reach some sort of compromise. While it is indeed unfortunate that a tragedy of the likes of Savar was the necessary catalyst to bring about dialogue between the government and opposition, it seems that our political leaders recognise that the time has come for national unity – that our country cannot afford a broken political system at such a time. The conciliatory moves made by both parties, withdrawing of hartals by BNP and the release of incarcerated opposition leaders on the part of the government, and the talks that are being scheduled between the two parties are hopefully a sign of things to come. With the elections coming up later in the year, it is imperative that these initiatives continue so that we can expect a free and fair election, where the voices of the people, which have been increasingly vocal as of late, can actually be heard through a legitimate democratic process.",

With that in mind, we want to come out on record once again. On the one hand, as we’ve stated before, neither is it justified for Hefazat to enforce the siege and coerce anyone on their part, nor can it block anyone from travelling in and out of Dhaka. To that end, the government must ensure that the people’s right to enter and leave Dhaka is uninhibited, and that they are not harassed by Hefazat. The government has been known to take sensible action when it comes to maintaining law and order during hartals and we expect to see a similar judiciousness and protection of the public’s freedom of movement in this instance. The situation isn’t that different from when the BNP or any other party holds a hartal and attempts to coerce the public into staying home or otherwise not engage in any activity. Hefazat shouldn’t be given any special treatment either. If the BNP or any other political party had resorted to coercion and force, how would the government react? The same case applies here for Hefazat. However, this doesn’t mean that the government gets carte blanche to run roughshod over Hefazat. Rather, they should simply enforce the rule of law. If any member of Hefazat-e-Islam breaks any laws, then measured action should be taken, but this is not license to use excessive force in the name of maintaining public order. The government and law enforcement must respect the rights of Hefazat even as it ensures that Hefazat is not permitted to trample the rights of the public.",

    "body": "Sheikh Hasina's recent interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour has caught the attention of many people in Bangladesh. While much can be said about the PM's performance, both good and bad, the aspect of the interview we would like to focus on here is the issue that was brought to light regarding press access and freedom in the nation. The interview covered the Savar tragedy from various dimensions that included circumstances (corruption, lack of enforcement, etc) that led to the incident, the government's response, the possible investment and export implications to the nation, and, of course, media freedom in the nation. We will not address the PM's response in this editorial. What we will say is that the interviewer's treatment of her guest was, to our eyes, in poor taste. Despite what Amanpour, or anyone else for that matter, may think of the PM, Hasina is the elected leader of our current government and should be accorded the respect her office commands and entitles her to. It is hard to imagine Ms Amanpour treating a western head of government with such disrespect. While we understand that Amanpour sought to ask the tough questions, there is no reason that she couldn’t maintain her journalistic integrity while still maintaining civility when addressing a foreign dignitary. It is commendable that the prime minister took the initiative to address an international audience in the wake of the Savar tragedy, but unfortunate that she has not deigned to offer the same access to the news media in Bangladesh. The general public would definitely be benefitted if the press in Bangladesh were allowed to ask Hasina the questions that are on everyone's mind. Additionally, the issue brought up about the limitations placed on the entry of foreign journalists to cover the tragedy is an issue that needs to be dealt with immediately. The PM was incorrect in her statement that there is no bar placed on foreign journalists who wish to come to Bangladesh. It is very difficult for foreign journalists to secure a visa to come here, and this is something she should not have cavalierly denied. If the nation wants to assure present or prospective investors that Bangladesh is indeed a safe bet, prohibiting the entry of foreign journalists is completely counter-intuitive. While these problems of press freedom and access are not exclusive to the ruling Awami League, they, as the current ruling party, should take the necessary steps to address these issues. The nation will be better off for it.",

The newly introduced benchmark index, DSEX, rose fractionally 0.38 points or 0.01% to 3468. The DSE30 lost 1.62 points or 0.12% to close at 1282. The Chittagong Stock Exchange Selective Category Index, CSCX, was up 1 point to 6830. The total turnover at DSE went down by 18% from previous session’s value and stood at Tk1.4bn. “Turnover declined 18%, indicating unwillingness of the investors to take position amid uncertain situation. Investors are waiting on the sidelines to see the economy and the political scenario to take a direction,” said Lanka Bangla Securities in its daily market analysis. Out of 273 issues traded, 125 advanced, 118 declined and 30 remained unchanged. “Seemingly, the bourse was arrested by the turmoil and anarchy over national political landscape, creating uncertainty and confusion over investment mindset,” said IDLC Investment. “However, as quarter-end declarations became available, earnings expectation-driven movement in script level was observed. Subsequently, eight of the top ten most traded scrips turned out to have recent declarations,” it also said. Micro caps companies continued to perform better than others. Among the positive performing sectors, non-banking financial institutions were slightly up 0.73% and pharmaceuticals 0.51%. But other big sectors, including banks, telecommunications and power were down. Engineering sector dominated the turnover that accounted for 14.16%, driven by Olympic Industries that gained 6.47%. Investors snapped up shares of the company as its third quarter report was up 17.11% compared to the corresponding period a year ago. Olympic Industries was the top turnover leader with shares worth Tk91.0m changed hands. Other turnover leaders were United Airways, CVO Petrochemical Refinery Limited, Beximco, Bengal Windsor Thermoplastics, Orion Pharma and Titas Gas.",

    "title": "The (un) importance of labels",
    "body": "I believe the term used to describe me for the last two months has been “chhagu.” A slang term that connotes a supporter of Islamist-leaning politics. Interesting, I thought, given the fact that my lifestyle choices are often in direct contradiction to being a radical Islamist. So, why am I a chhagu? Probably because I did not prescribe to the demand that Jamaat-e-Islami should be banned. Is it not possible that I could abhor religious politics, but could still believe that every citizen in a democracy has a right to his/her own opinion, no matter how opposed it is to mine? Now that I think of it, I realise that we love to put labels on everything and everyone. At its most basic level, of course it is easy to define someone or something, but this presents the risk that we see only in black and white! In spite of the fact that I’m colour blind, I’ve always believed my life is very colourful. So here I am, spending an introspective afternoon concerning myself with the “labels” that are often assigned to me. The first, of course, was the debate of Bangladeshi vs. Bangalee vs. Sylheti. I am all three, I thought. I am and always have been a citizen of this country. Tick for point one. My mother strongly claims her Dhakaiya roots, so that’s a tick for point two! My father and his family, for a few generations, have been from Sylhet (although, if we look back further, we can trace our roots elsewhere), so I guess tick for point three. Thus, I am a Bangladeshi Bangalee from Sylhet, to be absolutely precise about the matter. “Am I a Muslim?” I ask myself. I don’t pray, don’t perform many of the rituals required, and at times do things that are considered “haram.” But I do have faith. I do believe that Allah is the One, and I believe in His divine powers. So, I believe I am a Muslim. Then it started getting tricky: “What political beliefs do I hold?” I am a firm believer in a small government with little interference. The classical US Republican standpoint, except when it comes to the Democratic liberal attitudes I have towards personal freedoms of choice - pro-choice, pro-same gender marriage (pro-marriage equality), stricter gun control, etc. Hold on … I am not a voter in the US, so that makes all of these irrelevant! More relevant is the question of what my politics are closer to my reality? For one, I still hold that a government should have strong boundaries as to where its direct involvement can be – specifically in the areas concerning business. Unfortunately, none of the established political parties in Bangladesh explicitly promote that. So how do I choose? Most of the time, that choice is made for me. Many label me a “BNP” supporter because of a decision my father took in 1979! He had contested and won an election from that party. But after the 1991 elections, he became disillusioned and left politics altogether. Unfortunately for him, and for me, that label seemed to have stuck. I cannot speak for him, but I am not comfortable with this. While I have great respect and sympathy for the ideals of Ziaur Rahman, I think the “uttaradhikaris” of the party he created have drifted far from the politics he had preached. At present, I cannot claim to be on the same page with them on many points. Neither can the Awami League claim to be the party that it was in 1971, when it sparked the hopes of a nation. The Jatiya Party is a political group that I was opposed to even before I started to develop a political conscience. Jamaat and such parties have no appeal to me because I believe religion is a personal choice. A third force then? While in theory it is a good idea, it really isn’t practical. I think any change in the political landscape of the country has to come from reform of the existing two political camps. Thus, I am a political being without a home. I am, and have always been, an optimist. I think the future is bright for us as a nation. Ironically, and sadly for me, I am very pessimistic when it comes to the immediate future of my country. Due to our myopic goals, we are creating rifts in society that will take generations to mend. Labels. We seem to love them. But does it do justice to the complexities of our reality? We are so fast to utilise them that we overlook how inadequate it is to describe the person whom we are labelling, and goes on to reveal our lack of understanding of our own surroundings. In the end, what is this “Me”? There is only one label that I can truly, without a doubt, say is appropriate for me – a “kachchi biriyani lover.” Nazim Farhan Choudhury is Managing Director, Adcomm Ltd.",

    "title": "Bangladeshi politics and game theory",
    "body": "Mahmudur Rahman. The country’s most divisive figure. And the country is clearly divided. Mahmudur Rahman is the unchallenged leader of one side of that division. BNP is now only a side-show. And I don’t think BNP realises it yet. When BNP calls a hartal, 50 kids stand, laugh, and chant slogans. But when Mahmudur Rahman organised a crowd, almost 500,000 showed up. Mahmudur Rahman was not the excuse for that crowd, he called them. Look closely, Mahmudur Rahman broke his hunger strike at whose request? Allama Shafi. BNP thinks Mahmudur is standing with their support? Sorry, but that’s not the case. The force is with Mahmudur Rahman now, to borrow from Star Wars. Tarique Zia is in exile. In the last three months, so much water went down the Brahmaputra, but we didn’t even feel the presence of Tarique. Who is this Zubaida Rahman that Khaleda wants to set into the field? The public accepted Khaleda as the wife of President Zia with his image of honesty. But would they by default accept Tarique Zia’s wife? It’s not a sure bet. The Bangladeshi people are totally fed up with AL’s oppression. So who is left? Who is government’s biggest opposition? That person’s name is Mahmudur Rahman. And if you think he has no ambition, you are mistaken. Because every person in Bangladesh, all the way down to the person working in your house, thinks they can run the country better than these two unqualified women. That same thought could be in Mahmudur Rahman’s head. And Mahmudur Rahman’s history shows that he has never shown absolute loyalty to Khaleda Zia or BNP. There’s an article of his circulating on the internet, I think the title is “Khaleda Zia has nothing left, BNP is finished.” Now if he wanted to enter the fray with a new political party, he would get the support of Hefazat types, the nationalist types, and those who do not consider Tarique a viable alternative because of his history of corruption. All these forces combined create a big group in Bangladesh. Many people don’t want to understand that AL and BNP are complementary forces. Without BNP, AL cannot survive and vice versa. Let us bring this concept into the language of theory. There is a popular theory called “game theory.” It was designed by John Nash, about whom the amazing film “A Beautiful Mind” was made, starring Russel Crowe. Nash theorised that a society, state, or corporation always tries to attain maximum advantage for itself. We use all our strength and knowledge to take decisions that offer us maximum advantage and give our opponents maximum disadvantage. On the other hand, our opponents do the exact same thing. Now if everyone continues to harm each other like this, civilisation should be destroyed. Why doesn’t that happen? Remember in algebra, two negatives lead to a positive. You are harming them, they are harming you. These two sides cancel out, and society, or the state, stays in equilibrium. Nash proved all this with math, and designed the Nash Equilibrium. If this equilibrium is disturbed, both sides work to maintain stability, so they can continue to harm each other equally. If there is an imbalance, it cannot be sustained for very long. Now, apply this equation to AL and BNP. Each group harms the other, puts them in jail, makes them disappear. They do it in a way that their respective empires should collapse. But instead the two parties have been in equilibrium for 20 years. In more recent times, the equilibrium is breaking down. AL has continuously filled police ranks with loyalists, done the same with the special BCS cadre, provided licensed arms to militia-type groups of their own party, handed over all national wealth to their party people. Their strength keeps increasing. On the other hand, BNP is leaderless and growing weaker. So the Nash Equilibrium is falling apart. In order to return it to equilibrium, new forces will keep trying to fill the void, and we have to see which of them will last. That is why sometimes Nagarik Shakti’s Mahmudur Rahman Manna makes waves. In Prothom Alo, Dr Yunus’ brother Md Jahangir said that the youth need to organise - Hefazat got organised. When Shahbag stood up, I was one of those who said: expand your message. If you have the chance to grab control of the car, don’t be satisfied with just the steering wheel. But they did not take control, and the reason is explained in thousands of Facebook notes. But of all the forces that stood up recently, none showed the level of ambition, or became as powerful a force as Mahmudur Rahman. BNP lacks leadership and is in limbo. The nationalists are looking for a voice, a leader. Mahmudur Rahman is now related to Hefazat. Jamaat, cornered by Shahbag is ready to make Mahmudur Rahman their chief at any moment. Now if Mahmudur Rahman decides to dump BNP and advance on his own, it’s a dangerous situation for AL. Because there’s a huge difference between the nationalism of Mahmudur Rahman, and the nationalism of BNP. Those who think BNP is a right-wing party, have never experienced the ultra-right wing. And as a person, Mahmdur Rahman has very strong principles. Look at his hunger strike. It was to demand that the case against his mother, and against Daily Sangram be lifted. A very principled position, he did not go on strike to ask that charges against him be lifted. Mahmudur Rahman served jail before this as well. For “contempt of court.” When any other newspaper editor in Bangladesh was dragged to court on these charges, they begged forgiveness to escape a jail sentence. But not Mahmudur Rahman. You may not like him, and therefore ignore him – but you cannot cancel him. Mahmudur Rahman has already risen as a credible force. Hefazat’s huge April rally surprised everyone. It showed us that the song and story that our media feeds us day and night is not the whole – there is a huge community that falls outside this tale. And Mahmudur Rahman has been able to tap into that community. AL may not study game theory, but they are fully aware of Mahmudur Rahman’s strength. What AL does not understand is that if you keep acquiring unlimited power, and break the spine of a political party that is just as unprincipled and corrupt as you, eventually that will destroy the political equilibrium. And this will bring about the destruction of the AL itself. Whether it is through Mahmudur Rahman or Mahmudur Rahman Manna or anyone else. To save itself, it is urgent for AL to help BNP to survive. But will the power-blind Awami League understand that in time? An abbreviated version of this article was translated from the original Bangla and posted on alalodulal.org.",

    "title": "What binds us together?",
    "body": "It is exhausting being a Bangladeshi. Not a day goes by when you don’t observe some incident of a gross violation of justice, some form of avoidable tragedy, some cacophony of discourse and finger pointing, and you think to yourself: Is it worth it? 2013 has been a year of upheaval. In early February, the unexpected verdict of a convicted mass murderer, led the youth to finally realise that the concept of “justice” is one manufactured by political parties for their own expediency. Armed with tools which their elders could not understand and a new sense of urgency, they rose up and passionately demanded that justice be served and the most painful chapter of our history finally be closed. Initially united, it did not take long for the country to divide itself again, as politics inserted its ugly head into the debate. Is Shahbag a clever ploy by the government to distract the populace, asked the conspiracy theorists? Is it an attack on Islam, asked the religious? Shouldn’t the protesters be spending their time working, asked the baby boomers? Don’t we have other important issues to tackle, asked the skeptics? Then the conversation changed wildly, into a fight between those who felt that Islamic values were threatened and those who wanted to create a more secular Bangladesh. The country became even more divided, since nothing stokes as much passion as a perceived attack on religious values. Isn’t the defense of Islam our ultimate priority, asked the religious? Isn’t Islamic radicalism the greatest threat facing our country, asked the secularists? Then the usual partisan bickering started followed by indiscriminate strikes at the expense of the people’s wellbeing. In April, tragedy struck again; this time in Savar, where over 500 souls perished in one of the worst man-made disasters in our history. While initially, the people were shocked, divisions are again showing up. Should we blame the government? Should we blame the factory owners? Should we blame the foreign buyers? It is depressing. Bangladesh seems to be teetering on the brink. Everyone seems to have splintered off into factions. Everyone is pointing fingers and talking, but no one is talking to each other. In times like this, it is good to think not about our differences, but about what binds us. Is there anything that truly unites us? Who are we as a people? What are our values and what do we want to achieve? What kind of Bangladesh do we want to leave for our children? What are the attributes in us which would help us drive through this darkness? Then I had an epiphany. It was so simple. I looked around me at the people whose stories are often overlooked and whose heroics are often ignored. I thought about the doctor from Enam Medical College who is treating all the wounded for free; I thought about the young men and women who rushed to the scene of the accident to volunteer their time, to gather medical supplies, give blood and set up rescue efforts. I thought about a man who tirelessly worked on instilling values of leadership in the youth of the country; about the NGOs pioneering innovative concepts in social enterprises; about a man who won the Nobel prize for teaching the world that access to credit is a human right; about the entrepreneurs who are trying to innovate and create; about the migrant workers exhausting themselves in brutal conditions and sending billions back home to their families; I think about the common folk, struggling everyday against all odds, so that their children will have a better life. We call ourselves a broken society, full of corruption, greed and nepotism. And yes, that exists too, more than I would like. But we fail to celebrate the truly wonderful displays of selflessness and sacrifice, which we would see almost every day, if we only cared to look. We have become cynical and we think everyone has an agenda. We have let our disblief go to our head and stopped truly appreciating the wonders carried out by our people every day. So, the answer to the question, do we have what it takes to climb out of this darkness? Yes, we do. We can start by appreciating the good which is already being done and find inspiration in the small wonders which is keeping this country chugging along despite it’s so many tragedies. We have done well and we can do even better. Do you believe in Bangladesh? I do. Rezwan Khan is pursuing a Masters degree at Dartmouth College, USA.",

    "title": "Bankers’ new pay scale faces fresh setback",
    "body": "Implementation of separate pay scales for Bangladesh Bank and three state-owned commercial banks (SOBs) is facing a setback due to a fresh bureaucratic scrutiny. The secretaries’ committee, responsible for examining the proposal and recommend the government, during last three months sought different information about salaries and allowances the employees of the banks currently enjoy. In a latest move, the eight-member committee with cabinet secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan as its convenor has asked for information on car and house/land purchase loans by the employees as the employing banks pay the tax against the loans, officials said. It also asked for information on how Bangladesh Bank, Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks pay the lunch and iftar allowances to their employees. Authorities have already spent three months from an instruction by high government authorities to promptly finalise recommendation for the separate pay scales for the bankers, according to sources at the Banking & Financial Institutions Division of finance ministry. Officials alleged that asking for the new information is nothing but a strategy to delay the process as they made an assessment on the salaries and allowances two years back. They urged the cabinet division to expedite the process, said one of them, requesting anonymity. Finance Minister AMA Muhith in January this year had asked the authorities concerned to implement the pay scales within June. He had also directed the cabinet division to complete the task by the month. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier approved specific guidelines for the separate pay scales. As per the guidelines, the new salaries and bonuses for the bankers must be market-based and attractive. It would be different from those of the government officials. The existing salaries and other perks of the employees concerned would not be affected when the separate scales would come into effect. But, the employees will not be entitled to lunch or other entertainment allowances while maintenance allowance for houses will be included under the head of house allowance. Conveyance and entertainment allowances will be given to all categories of employees concerned. Health allowance will be included under the head of expenses for medicine and education and it will be limited to only for two children up to the age of 21 in case of the members of the lower-level staff. Currently, the SOBs employ nearly 90,000 people and Bangladesh Bank around 6,000. Previously, the finance minister had proposed the pay scales for the bankers with an increase in the basic pay ranging from 6% to 62%. The highest gross salary of a general manager would have been Tk64,000 per month as per the proposal. Bangladesh Bank and the state-owned banks, however, demanded a hike up to 80% in the basic pay.",

The Prime Minister made the request when outgoing Ambassador of the Philippines to Bangladesh Bahnarim Abu Guinomla made a farewell call on her at her office in the morning. After the meeting, PM’s press secretary Abul Kalam Azad briefed reporters. The Prime Minister said the import of Bangladeshi pharmaceutical products to the Philippines would bring down the prices of medicines in the Filipino market as this initiative will significantly help the locals avail themselves of better health care services. Hasina stressed holding regular meetings of the Joint Trade Commission between Bangladesh and the Philippines to ensure enhanced bilateral trade in a win-win manner for both the friendly countries. Underscoring the importance of private sector collaboration between the two sides, she said such collaborations can play a significant role in augmenting the bilateral trade between the two countries. In this regard, she suggested more frequent exchange of visits of business leaders to strengthen the trade relations in terms of volume of trade in the coming days. The Prime Minister also emphasised implementation of bilateral agreements and MoUs signed between Bangladesh and the Philippines as of 2012 for the mutual benefits of the two nations. She also expressed the hope that the existing bilateral relations between the two countries would be further strengthened in the days to come. Ambassador at-Large M Ziauddin, PM’s Principal Secretary Shaikh Md Wahid uz Zaman, PMO Secretary Molla Waheeduzzman and Press Secretary Abul Kalam Azad were, among others, present at the meeting.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Bank has been requested to provide the merchant banks and broker houses with a refinance facility of Tk12.67bn under the ‘special scheme’ to help investors recover a part of their losses incurred due to the capital market debacle since late 2010. The government had announced the scheme 15 month ago. The Banking and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance has served a letter to Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Atiur Rahman, seeking necessary measures to fund the scheme, according to a document obtained by the Dhaka Tribune. Small investors have often alleged that the special scheme has not been implemented due to non-cooperation of certain stakeholders in the sector. The scheme implementation committee, headed by Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) Managing Director Md Fayekuzzaman, recommended 50% waiver of interest on margin loans taken by small investors having their investment up to Tk1m in the listed securities as of December 2011. Bangladesh Merchant Bankers Association (BMBA) sought Tk9.13bn in loan from the Bangladesh Bank at an interest rate of 10% to make the special scheme effective while broker houses of Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges sought Tk7.27bn. The total amount will then stand at Tk15.41bn, which they sought from the authorities like banking division and Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission. Merchant banks provided Tk50bn as margin loans to their clients and now they will have to waive an interest worth Tk6.5m against the accounts of 41,992 clients. The SEC had unveiled a 21-point stock market rejuvenation package, including the 'special scheme' for small investors on November 23, 2011. According to a BSEC estimate, 28 merchant banks and 209 broker houses of DSE and 79 broker houses of CSE will have to waive interests on margin loans provided to their clients. Only the ICB has so far waived interest on margin loans amounting to around Tk140m.",

    "title": "Tangail to get first district-wise budget",
    "body": "The government for the first time is going to introduce district-wise budget for Tangail on a pilot basis in the upcoming fiscal year. A circular was issued on Sunday asking the ministries and divisions to submit proposed allocations to the finance division by Thursday. Some 51 ministries and divisions of the government have been asked to collect data on budgetary allocations the district received in the past three fiscal years. While announcing first budget of the present government in 2009, Finance Minister AMA Muhith had said the government would introduce district-wise budgets to ensure equal and transparent distribution of resources of the country. However, the minister later admitted their failure in introducing the district-wise budgets. But the government wants to launch it from the next fiscal for Tangail district first on a pilot basis, he said. The two-page circular signed by additional secretary of finance division Ranjit Kumar Chakraborty said that introducing the district budget is a difficult task as finance division cannot determine how much fund will come from the national exchequer, local government institutions and private sector. AMA Muhith said they will include a key pledge of strengthening local governments further in their next electoral manifesto. But, M Hafizuddin Khan, a former adviser to a caretaker government, said strengthening local governments is already in the ruling party’s election manifesto. “But they have not materialised it.” While talking to the Dhaka Tribune, he urged the government to ensure strong local government before it completes the tenure. For Tangail district, there will be budget for next fiscal year as well as revised and actual budgets of the current fiscal. Besides, the projected allocations for the fiscal years 2014-15 and 2017-18 will be proposed. The budgetary allocation required for consecutive five fiscal years should be sent to the finance division by today, according to the circular. As per the circular, budget for upazilas and main budgetary allocation for the districts will be added to the district budgets. The policy will be applied in preparing Tangail district budget too, the circular said. In addition, the district budget will have allocation of allowances like VGF, VGD and TR. Municipality budgets will also be there, finance division said. It further said ministries and divisions will receive allocations for development and non-development budgets for Tanagil district. The form added with circular will be fulfilled by the ministries and division while seeking funds for different sectors for the district. Finance division has formed a four-member committee to ensure transparency in making budgetary allocations. The ministries and divisions can collect forms from finance division’s website, according to the circular.",

    "body": "We were in Sylhet in May when we experienced a 5.8 quake. It was a modern building, built to earthquake resistant specifications, so nothing fell down. Nevertheless it was a pretty scary experience and made us wonder what would happen in Dhaka. Now we know! No, this is not good news, but most people have known this for ages and still keep constructing unsafe buildings! Slip of FB! Just finish by saying such a quake is inevitable. The 1897 Great India Earthquake was caused by the readjustment of the Shillong Plateau. That plateau is still readjusting, but there have been no shocks, yet, originating in that process. It seems highly probable that, sooner or later, another severe adjustment will result in another such catastrophic quake. Hi. How are you? Dhaka is in a prime location for a massive quake, has a massive population, and the buildings are not built to proper standards to withstand such a quake. That's plenty to be concerned about. It could be any city of the world. Why Dhaka?? Mohammad Masuk Imtiaz You don’t need an expert to say that!! Dhaka will be [the] next Lost City of “Pompeii!” Mohammad Zahinul Islam [This is] nothing new. So scary! Allah Malik! If this is so well-known, and terrifying, why are we still ignoring the warnings?? We are such hypocrites that it's...I have no words. We claim to love our lives, would do anything to keep fattening our pocketbooks, and yet completely ignore all preparations that we might make for a potential earthquake, never mind a fire. What about carrying out a fire and earthquake drill? In each office and school, once a month, just in case. Now there's an idea. Do we really want to survive or have we given up already? Or we just don't give a shit, about anyone, even ourselves.",

    "body": "These are truly difficult times for the law enforcement authorities. The job of maintaining law and order and protecting the safety and freedom of movement of the general public in the face of the Hefazat’s Dhaka blockade programme was a daunting one. Doing so without over-reaching and resorting to brutality and excessive violence, in such a tense and frightening environment, was even more challenging, though we are glad to note that the authorities were wise enough to recognise its necessity. Thus, we should congratulate our law enforcement and be deeply appreciative for a job well done. As they continue to fight pitched battles in the street with a segment of the Hefazat activists, they have conducted themselves with admirable restraint and discipline, especially when you consider the danger inherent in facing off against tens of thousands armed with sticks and other weapons and bent on mayhem. At last count, two protesters and one innocent bystander lie dead and scores have been injured, but, by all accounts, the police and other law enforcement have done everything in their power to minimise casualties and ensure that the situation has not spiralled out of control, which it easily could have done. The paramount concern of law enforcement must be to keep the peace and to protect the rights and freedoms of the general public. Given the enormity of what they were up against, all of us in Dhaka have reason to be grateful to the police for the way in which they have ensured our safety, to a large extent. The second, and related, concern, must be to act with only as much violence as the situation calls for. This is both out of respect for the rights of those who are protesting, even those who do so violently, as well as out of an understanding that fighting fire with fire will only lead to further conflagration that could endanger the general public. We are rarely appreciative enough of the men and women in uniform who keep the peace during political turmoil, putting their lives on the line for us.",

    "body": "Initially, the government’s handling of Hefazat-e-Islam’s Dhaka siege had been admirably restrained. The police had been given instructions to not lose their heads, and even the Chhatra League only entered the fray after the AL party office had come under attack by Hefazat protesters. It could be argued that it would have been wiser for the government to have given permission for Hefazat’s rally in the capital earlier, and thus been able to plan for it better. But, all things considered, the way in which they addressed Hefazat’s stated goal to blockade Dhaka and cut it off from the rest of the country was a model of restraint and prudence. Indeed, many have argued that the government should have taken a firmer stand and should have come down on Hefazat with an iron fist. We are however cognizant of the pressures that they have been under and are appreciative of the wisdom inherent in trying to defuse the situation with careful and cautious handling. However, it now seems as though that initial caution is likely to be abandoned. Hefazat has done itself no favours with its violence and incendiary rhetoric against the government and announcement that it will not be moved from the streets until its 13-point charter of demands is accepted. This was an open provocation to the government, and it seems clear that Hefazat is bent on provoking a confrontation. While it is important for the government to project strength and to not be cowed by Hefazat, and ultimately to do everything in its power to both protect the general public and to not give in to political blackmail, we only urge that it continue to exercise caution and restraint. It is a tough balance to keep and we do not envy the government its responsibility. We only caution that, as it does its job of maintaining law and order, that it keep in mind that precipitous or disproportionate action will only throw further fuel on the fire.",

    "title": "Moral hazard and our RMG industry",
    "body": "Risk and reward should ideally go hand in hand. If we take excess risks, and it leads to success, then the reward is usually high. However, when excessive risk results in something bad, we must be ready to bear the costs of that decision. In economics, “moral hazard” refers to a situation where one party takes excessive risk because that party knows that it would not have to bear the costs of that risk. Such an environment promotes excessive risk taking which is usually detrimental to the whole society and the economy. The best recent example of moral hazard is the US government’s bailout of the financial sector that fell into problems after the sub-prime bubble burst. The financial sector had earlier taken huge risks in real estate and also reaped the benefits through huge profits and personal bonuses. However, when things went south, they got bailed out by the general people of the country. What does RMG have to do with moral hazard? A lot, actually. The typical RMG factory owner knows that if there is a problem in their factory caused by their negligence (Tazreen Fashions and Rana Plaza are both cases in point), their associations will come to their rescue. So by giving less attention to worker safety they are able to lower some costs and take higher risks because they know they will be bailed out. The other interesting information that I came across was that banks have decided to raise around Tk1bn for the Savar victims. The newspaper article mentioned that they did it on the request of the central bank. A few might have taken initiatives at their own discretion but I would contend, for most, the central bank request had a lot to do with it. Why should banks pay for a mistake made by garment factory owners or building owners? Even though some people believe that banks should be more responsible before lending to organisations, I think that banks should stick to their core operation. The responsibility of checking whether a building meets construction standards is not the core operation of a bank and thus should be left to relevant authorities like Rajuk. Banks are already in a fragile situation due to loan scams, political problems, real estate slowdown, etc, and asking them to pay for others’ mistakes is a recipe for disaster. Tomorrow if banks get into trouble, who will bail them out? Of course it will be the average citizen of the country who did nothing wrong. Being an optimist I honestly believe that most of the factory owners do care about the safety of their employees. It is a few rotten ones that are causing the image crisis we presently face. But we can still blame BGMEA on the grounds that they are not penalising the rotten ones for their failures. So, it is the responsibility of the factory owners, the foreign buyers and the BGMEA to pay for the rehabilitation of the victims and not the responsibility of banks. Of course people are free to donate of their own free will but making an innocent group pay for the mistakes of other people will only exacerbate the problem. Asif Khan is an Investment Analyst.",

    "title": "Where will Bangladesh go without duty-free access",
    "body": "Fear has recently been stalking the corridors of the Bangladeshi RMG sector and as a result the economy as whole. Rightly so, for the industry now accounts for over 75% of exports and has shown phenomenal growth of around 12% annually. Garments now represent 13% of the country’s GDP, but industry experts claim that if EU duty-free access dries up, as could happen, many factories would close down over night. The EU is the largest export market for the sector, but if the EU removes the country’s status it would add 12.5% onto the cost of Bangladeshi garments overnight. RMG bosses say this would push down competitiveness in relation to China, despite the fact that Chinese wages are increasing rapidly and are already many times higher than Bangladeshi wages. This then asks a question of where Bangladesh should head. It is without doubt that the sector has been overly reliant on foreign policies from inception. Indeed it was the 1974 Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) conceived by western nations to combat the challenge of East Asian economies, such as South Korea, that prompted the growth in RMG in Bangladesh. This gave quotas to countries to prevent western markets being swamped by products from emerging economies. This then made western importers seek new sourcing nations who were not fulfilling their MFA quotas, such as Bangladesh. How did the MFA-affected exporters of the 1970s respond? South Korea is a valuable case in point. In the 1950s the country lay in ruins. Now it’s hi-tech manufacturers are the “only thing between Apple and world domination,” according to South Korean Cambridge economist, Ha-Joon Chang. This happened in spite of western quotas, policies or economic prescriptions, and it didn’t happen because of the inherent work ethic of Koreans. The Korean economy ironically picked up in the 1970s through government prescription, protectionism, and policies that ran contrary to the wisdom of western orthodox economists. The birth of POSCO, which started producing steel in 1972, is a case in point. In a country with no natural energy to operate smelters and no iron ore, this seemed a misnomer. However, POSCO, as of 2010, was the largest steel maker by market value and the Korean economy is now the 15th largest on the planet. The point about steel is not that Bangladesh should imitate this; instead it is that policy should look to feed downstream growth, as steel did in South Korea. Bangladeshi wages are some of the lowest in the world. This fact cannot be relied upon. According to a recent study by management consultants McKinsey & Co. Bangladeshi wages will increase by around 30% in 3 years. If this is coupled with removals of duty free status, the country’s exports will become increasingly uncompetitive. This should not mean that Bangladesh abandons garments, it just means that value and efficiency need to be added wherever it can. Short-sighted profits will not help. This is why government policy is essential. McKinsey surveyed corporate bosses from the RMG sector and note that “the current lack of any noteworthy own raw materials, supply of natural or man-made fibres in Bangladesh weighs even stronger, beyond immediate issues of lead time increase.” If everything has to be imported to make the garment and is expensive, and slow to procure as a result, this becomes a major concern for bosses, which is ultimately balanced out through low wages. This points at two deficiencies, infrastructure, making imports slow, and a lack in the manufacturing of raw materials for garments. In the case of China it has become a leading exporter through, “artificially cheap raw materials, components, energy and land,” according to the Harvard Business Review. Subsidising spinners and artificial fibre manufacturing through tax incentives could therefore be an area where affirmative government economic action could occur. Infrastructure on the other hand is a well-known problem, on which the Padma Bridge issue weighs heavy, as does the tedium in realising new power projects. Whilst this government has increased megawatts available to the RMG sector, it is clear that Bangladesh’s building stock capacity suffers at the hands of strong parties and weak bureaucracies. Positive plans that are made could ultimately get ripped up the next time we have a change of “Begums.” Herein, it would be highly advisable if certain areas of economic policy could be ring-fenced, above and beyond party politics, as a national priority to prevent policy changes induced by a change in government.

    "title": "Banana Republicans: Time to pick a side",
    "body": "There is a very contemporaneous quote by Roy Barnes that is worth considering today: “We are all one or at least we should be — and it is our job, our duty, and our great challenge to fight the voices of division and seek the salve of reconciliation.” Division is the poison that destroys nations. It has done so in the past and it continues to do so now. This is common knowledge to most. Yet, we all participate in divisiveness quite actively. Why? How much more blood need be spilled before we understand the destructive nature of the beast whose belly we now live in? I have educated friends from all spheres, my twitter friends and those on facebook — who have chosen sides in the politics we see unfolding in front of us today and I find it flabbergasting that they do not recognise a simple fact that no one is without blame and our system is totally broken; that if you choose sides, you are doing a disservice to your nation, fellow countrymen, your moral standards, and intelligence, and selling yourself short. You are acquiescing to unknown people with unknown agendas, to parties and movements that truly deep down you do not and cannot, by standards of decency, support. Awami League, BNP, Jatiyo Party, Jamaat etc, who really has ever fought for the betterment of this country lately? Ask yourself that. You look at the recent history of this nation and its clear, they have only ever fought and shown leadership for their own survival and all their means are directed to that end. How much more blatant do their activities, misrepresentations and buffoonery have to be for you to say: “You know what, my support of this system is insulting to me.” The prime minister extends an olive branch, the country appreciates the effort, and then we end up with an ultimatum. All this has happened before and will surely continue into the future. They cannot bring themselves to sit on a table together to improve their own working environment because of inflated egos and score settling, and you expect them to fight for you? Therefore unless you have an intention to launch a party of your own and gather like-minded good people, and have the strength and fortitude, both monetarily and organisationally, to push through reforms, I suggest you go about your daily lives ignoring politics altogether. Forgive me for being a naysayer, but you can only be actively helpful to your country when you first shut off from contributing to the ongoing poisonous rhetoric and admit that the system is rigged and broken. I am saving you the pain and recurrent disappointment. I implore you, the least you can do to help this sham of a democracy, lest it get worse, is to not participate. Yes, in an age when everyone encourages one to participate, I am advocating that you do not participate. I am asking you to be a cynic, a skeptic. I am asking you to seek answers. I am asking you to value your democratic right. Don’t vote either. I ask this because your voice is being misconstrued to mean that you support those active in politics today. You are fueling their power. Well, I am fed up with that. No one represents me in our politics and they do not represent you, either. When someone tells you otherwise, ridicule them. Tell them your support is valuable. That your voice is not on sale and you have little wish to sell out cheaply. The killing, arson, looting, political bickering, lies, insensitivity, cruelty, fights and protests will as usual continue to be a part of our lives but at least it will not have your support and your conscience will be clear. So I am asking you to pick a side and the side I am asking you to pick is your own and if you have any hope left, then in earnest, back your country. Only when you pick that side and admit to yourself we have a problem, can you truly begin to fight the division that poisons Bangladesh.

    "title": "The realm of the eff-able",
    "body": "The latest shenanigans of Hefazat must have the famous philosopher Søren Kierkegaard rolling in his grave. To Kierkegaard, the concept of God is rooted in infinity, and by implication cannot be comprehended through words invented by human beings who are, in contrast, finite. God is beyond verbal comprehension, which is why, according to Kierkegaard, God can only be understood through silent contemplation, or the realm of the ineffable. Of course, to the Hefazat ilk, God is not only describable - they can describe Him better than anybody else. To be fair to Hefazat, they are just one of many religious cabals throughout history who claim to own the exclusive truth about God. Moreover, such absolutism has usually been defended and promoted through violence and terror. The beliefs of Hefazat not only emanate from the realm of vulgarity, these are blasphemous as well because they ascribe their own personality traits on to God. To make God in a person’s image is the worst form of idolatry conceivable. The texts of monotheistic religions take a very dim view of idolatry. In an allegorical sense, idol worshipping is likely to put one on an express lane to Hell with absolutely no chance of having even a wink at the 72 virgins. Of course, no one knows whether the Hefazat lot are doomed to Hell - and that’s the point. No one, except God knows that. In a similar vein, it is up to God to deal with unbelievers. Through their caterwauling speeches, Hefazat has been trying to convince us that the unbelievers of Shahbagh deserve to be lynched. This form of vulgar absolutism comes from a very selective reading of religious texts where revelation pertained to specific historical circumstances. For all the Quranic references that Hefazat can show about punishing unbelievers, it is possible to demonstrate many other passages where it clearly states that unbelievers should be forgiven. Moreover, there are even sections in the Quran where believers are admonished that whether a person believes is none of our business. It is this gentleness and kindness espoused by religion that predominantly defines the beliefs of Bangladeshi Muslims. And this is why the form of Islam espoused by Hefazat is so alien to us. In fact, religion is so deeply embedded in our lives that anyone who claims that Islam is in danger in our nation is probably blind, mad, deaf, or more likely, someone with a venomous political agenda. There was very little evidence of religious spirit at Shapla Chottor. However, there was plenty of it at Savar where people from all religions, socio-economic classes, and ages risked their lives to rescue people they had never even met. And this is precisely why Hefazat shall never represent us. The fact that they chose to turn Dhaka into a warzone at a time the entire nation is mourning Savar shows just how alienated they are from public sentiment. There may have been hundreds of thousands of Hefazat people at Shapla Chottor, but there are tens of millions of us throughout the country. With God on our side, we shall overcome.

    "body": "No matter what provoked Hefazat-e-Islam into abandoning their “peaceful” protest, and whether or not the government used excessive force on them during the siege, it was unacceptable for Hefazat-e-Islam to run riot through downtown Dhaka. Vehicles were vandalised, fires lit, and shops razed by Hefazat protesters in the area between Purana Paltan and Baitul Muqarram, as well as opposite the northern gate of Baitul Muqarram, in the market off its northern wing, in Naya Paltan, in front of the Bangladesh Communist Party office, Shokaler Khobor office, Mukti Bhaban, Stadium Market, in Sukrabad, as well as Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation building. Hefazat claims there was infiltration by Jamaat and BNP activists who were responsible for the fires. Nevertheless, even if there were infiltrators, this gives no one the license to vandalise and set anything ablaze. In fact, if there were infiltrators, and if Hefazat truly meant to hold a peaceful protest, then why didn’t they themselves hold the infiltrators accountable when they began to set the fires? Instead, not only were the fires not prevented, the one at Mukti Bhaban was relit after fire services had put it out. From the beginning, the police had refrained from being violent. They retaliated in a way that would ensure they dispersed the protesters but still held control over the situation. Hefazat, on the other hand, came forward with already hostile and confrontational rhetoric. Their intent was to besiege the city, and their actions were violent and combative. This does not mean we are dismissing Hefazat’s concerns. On the contrary, as we have said before, they have a right to their beliefs. They have the right to petition the government and voice their concerns. They do not, however, have the right to turn downtown Dhaka into a battle zone and vandalise vehicles and businesses at will.

An inordinate amount of teenaged and even pre-teen boys were seen in the belligerent crowd, chanting at the rally or confronting the police in street battles. While we wait for confirmation about how many have been killed or who instigated the enormous destruction to Dhaka’s central business district, we know that some of these boys were hurt in the pounding clashes that took place on May 5. It’s most unfortunate that children have been thrust into this conflict and were forced to face heavily armed law enforcers. Boys from madrasas and orphanages were consciously included to swell Hefazat-e-Islam’s ranks; their teachers brought thousands of them to Dhaka. Given that they had come prepared for a fight or even, by their own admission, to die, means that the people who brought them had anything but their best interests in mind. Madrasa students often belong to the lower echelons of society and are, along with orphans, among the more disenfranchised people in our country. The madrasas and orphanages provide them with sanctuaries, a basic education and often a livelihood when they go on to become Imans and khatibs of mosques, so quite naturally their loyalty to their teachers and carers is somewhat unshakable. But even if that were not the case, young boys are easily led and are not in a position to go against instructions given to them by people in authority. When those same people use them and manipulate their religious convictions to put them directly in harm’s way, it’s nothing short of treachery. They are charged with looking after them, not sending them into battle and then abandoning them on the field, which is exactly what was done when leaders and senior members of Hefazat conveniently disappeared from Motijheel before the police drive. But there are fingers to be pointed at the state as well. The fact that Hefazat-e-Islam’s call is the only voice these boys recognise means that a cavernous gap exists between them and the nation they belong to.",

He should resign after making such comments. [In the] Savar tragedy, around 550 human beings were killed. One minister offered his “Push-pull Theory.” Now, to rub salt to the wound, another minister says that it is “not really serious.” The minister’s remark is unfortunate and unacceptable; he should offer an apology. His stupidity knows no bounds. I think a competition is going on between him and MK Alamgir (the home minister) as to who is the greatest madman. A few days ago, [the] home minister scored an over boundary and [then] it [was the] finance minister’s turn to hit a six, in terms of madness. Really crazy. Shahzia Mohsin Khan Chingri-La [The] PM says Savar [was] an “accident” and Mal, as usual, [is] carefree. “Not serious” shows how much regard he has for the people that passed away. Absolutely shameful. How many people need to die before they consider it to be “serious?”",

    "body": "If [the concerned] authorities are really serious about proper punishment [for the] Savar disaster case, they should monitor the case from the beginning and supervise that appropriate charges are drawn under proper rules of the law. No words should be there like “it was told” or “may have been” ie no vague terms [should] be used. This is how it should be: for any criminal case, the Police/ IO’s report is the most important document for the prosecution. It is the duty of the Police as well as the govt leaders to duly perform their responsibilities to deliver justice. May I appeal to your conscientiousness to play a due role and not compromise here? Let us punish the criminals, not [carry out] witch hunting and blame games which end nowhere. Wali: Sir, do you believe in the independence of the police and the judiciary? Or do you prefer our PM deny the claim that Sohel Rana belonged to the ruling party? Forget everything else and ask your conscience the answers to these questions. TooScaredToWriteRealName While our ministers are busy with their children (opening fashion shows, ensuring their comfort on official trips abroad, finalising their cuts in deals), our country is very quietly sliding into hell. Perhaps the time has come to take a closer look at our constitution. Every single government has consistently failed to deliver on every single section of that hallowed document. Change it, so it clearly states Each To His Own. Or change the people who make decisions on behalf of our state. Run the country as you should, or get the hell out. Enough is enough. Keep the pressure up. Don’t let them make Rana the fall guy for everything.",

Pace sensation Mustafizur Rahman recorded his best bowling figures of the Indian Premier League today when he finished with 3 for 16 in Sunrisers Hyderabad’s 85-run victory over Mumbai Indians at Vishakhapatnam. The three-wicket haul took the left-armer to joint-second in the wicket-takers’ list with a total tally of 13 scalps from nine matches. He is one short of Mitchell McClenaghan, who has taken 14 wickets in 10 matches. The 20-year-old currently has the best bowling average, 15.61, and best economy rate, 6.15, amongs bowlers who have played at least eight matches in the tournament. The Sunrisers Hyderabad might have depended on Mustafizur a number of times in the ongoing Indian Premier League, but today was a collective effort. Ashish Nehra, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Barinder Sran had reduced the Mumbai Indians to 49 for 6 in nine overs before Mustafizur was given the ball. The wily left-armer sent back Hardik Pandya with his first ball with a cutter which Pandya failed to adjust himself against. Pandya attempted a slice through point, but the ball curled away to the hands of the keeper, with the umpire judging that out even though the television replays were inconclusive. Then in the very first ball of his second over again, Fizz bowled yet another slower delivery which moved away from the batsman, getting the edge of Tim Southee on the way to the keeper. The man from Satkhira returned got the scalp of McClenaghan in the final delivery of his third over, getting the batsman to offer a loopy catch to midwicket. Mustafizur did not get to bowl a fourth over as David Warner gave the other bowlers their chance to mop up the tail. And they did efficiently, bundling out the hosts for just 92 runs in 16.3 overs. Earlier, brilliant performances from Hyderabad openers, Warner and Shikhar Dhawan helped the team post 177. Dhawan scored 82 off 57 while Warner smacked 48 off 33. Yuvraj Singh also had a good time with the bat, scoring 39 off 23.

Meanwhile, CU Chhatra League President Rejaul Haque Rubel claimed that he identified five people who were involved in the crime. \"One of the five is Azim Hossain, a follower of BCL sub-group 'CFC'. Azim knows about the rest of the culprits. I got five names from him,\" Rubel told this correspondent.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Admitting that the Power Division could not impose schedule-wise power cuts across the country, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid yesterday sought one week's time to address the issue. \"In many places, load shedding continued for more than an hour. We've seen that a feeder takes 2-3 hours to resume electricity supply after being shut. In many areas, it takes 4 hours. This has happened in my area also. We need one week's time to assess the situation and address it,\" the state minister told reporters at his Gulshan residence in the capital. The government will plan its next steps for electricity rationing after analysing the data of the first week of power outages, he said. The government on Tuesday imposed countrywide power cuts with timetables for specific areas as part of austerity measures to save fuel amid soaring energy prices in the global market. It also has temporarily shut down all diesel-fired power plants, which contribute 1,000-1,500MW to the national grid daily. The state minister said new schedules for load shedding will be fixed next week and the situation is likely to improve as time progresses. He said they would fix another load shedding schedule after having the first week's results. \"Customers are accepting the situation due to special circumstances. I think we can put things in order in 10 days and the situation will get better after that,\" Nasrul said. Responding to a question, the state minister said he was expecting that alternative energy (energy sources other than fossil fuels) would be used in some power plants and that is why he was terming the current situation temporary. He said the demand for power would fall gradually in the \"coming season\" and they would be able to deal with the situation. Nasrul, however, said the oil and gas crises would worsen if the Russia-Ukraine war continued, adding that there would not be any problem if people used electricity sensibly. He also highlighted the differences between the demands for electricity in cities and rural areas. \"It is found that three villages collectively use 10MW power every day, but one locality in Dhaka alone uses about 100MW. This is a problem.\" He said the demand for gas in factories and industrial units is also increasing. \"The majority of our gas supplies are being sent to industries.\" The state minister said only 10 percent of the country's total diesel stock is used for power generation and the rest is used by agriculture and transportation sectors. Nasrul said the overall power supply deficit is now crossing the 1,500MW mark daily. \"In the last two-three days, we observed that the load shedding was 1,500 MW every day. Sometimes the figure went up by 400-500MW when the usage of gas increased in industries.\" He also said Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation has recently held meetings with the transport sector stakeholders. \"The meetings were held to analyse how much increase in transport fares would be needed if the fuel prices are hiked by the BPC,\" he said. The BPC was yet to adjust fuel prices with the additional import prices, the state minister said.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Renowned Bangladeshi mountaineer Wasfia Nazreen conquered the treacherous K2 in Pakistan, becoming the first person from Bangladesh to summit the second-tallest mountain in the world. The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly involved should be punished both academically and legally. If any leader tried to cover up the incident, they should also be withdrawn from their post.\" Fazle Rabbi Sugan, former general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"As a former BCL leader, I am ashamed. BCL is a renowned organisation and always stands for student rights.\" The information about the victim's whereabouts is now being protected. CU Proctor Robiul Islam said, \"She is in a safe place under our supervision. We are providing everything she needs. However, for the sake of investigation, her location cannot be disclosed.\" Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners.

The High Court yesterday came down hard on Bangladesh Railway for mismanagement, ticket scalping and carrying passengers on the train roofs. \"If any train carries passengers on its roof, appropriate actions will be taken against the officials concerned,\" said the court. The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.  The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendations. It decided that the Finance Division would issue a circular to cut 20 percent energy sector expenditure. Officials would avoid in-person meetings and foreign trips as much as possible. Markets would be monitored to keep prices of essentials at a tolerable level and action would be taken against hoarders. The National Board of Revenue will take steps at the beginning of the financial year to increase internal resource mobilisation and to achieve the revenue collection target. The meeting also asked all ministries to review their procurement plans and take initiatives to reduce expenditure. Talking to reporters afterwards, Kaikaus said, \"There's no reason to panic. These are precautionary measures so that we don't have to face any kind of crisis in the future.\" He urged non-government organisations to follow suit. Hours after the meeting, the water resources ministry issued an office order asking its officials to avoid personal use of government vehicles and set the thermostats at 26 degrees Celsius at the Pani Bhaban.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The BNP yesterday skipped Election Commission's dialogue seeking recommendations of political parties on how to hold a free and fair general election. BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus. Whether there is consensus or not, we said we will continue our efforts.\" Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The price of gold has started to drop in the domestic market, just a day after hitting ahistoric high of Tk 2.52 lakh per bhori, following a decline in international gold prices. According to new prices announced by the Bangladesh Jewellers Association (Bajus), 22-carat gold will be sold at Tk 2.49 lakh per bhori from tomorrow, marking Tk 3,000 drop from tomorrow. The slight drop in price comes following a series of historic hikes in recent weeks, with prices of the precious metal gold climbing from Tk 2.30 lakh per bhori three weeks ago. On Thursday, gold prices fell as risk appetite improved after US President Donald Trump backed off from threats of Greenland‑related tariffs, with profit-booking in the wake of recent gains adding pressure, reports Reuters. Spot gold slipped 0.4 percent to $4,819.39 per ounce, after falling nearly 1 percent earlier in the session, it said, adding that US gold futures for February delivery lost 0.3 percent to $4,821 per ounce, it added. The precious metal, often considered a safe-haven investment, breached $4,800 per ounce for the first time on Wednesday, as rising geopolitical tensions, including US President Donald Trump’s Greenland developments, drove demand.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur today urged Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed to fast-track the process of amending the Bangladesh Bank Order 1972 and the Bank Companies Act before the upcoming national election. In response, the adviser expressed doubt, saying he was ‘unsure’ whether the two laws could be amended before the polls scheduled for February 12 this year. The conversation between the two senior government officials took place at a roundtable on banking sector reforms, organised by the English daily The Financial Express and Mutual Trust Bank at Six Seasons Hotel in Dhaka. At the event, the adviser was the chief guest and the governor the special guest. The roundtable was also attended by a number of managing directors of private and state-owned banks, along with business leaders. Business leaders and bankers put forward various suggestions and demands, while the managing directors expressed their support for the reforms proposed by the governor. However, the finance adviser pointed to time constraints and his limitations. When the governor noted that amending the laws after the election would be difficult, the adviser replied: “We will try. However, the time is short, so we are not sure how much can be accomplished.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Taxpayers may seek to cancel their Income Tax Registration—essentially cancelling their Tax Identification Number (TIN)—for various reasons, such as the complete loss of business or source of income, long periods of no taxable income, changes in the legal structure of the business (e.g., transitioning from a sole proprietorship to a company), wrongful or unnecessary registration, the administrative hassles of filing regular returns, or the risk of possible penalties. Considering these circumstances, Section 262 of the Income Tax Act, 2023 outlines the provisions for the cancellation of taxpayer registration. According to the law, a person can apply for cancellation of their registration under certain conditions. For example, if the taxpayer is no longer required to file a return under Section 264 and is no longer defined as a taxpayer under Section 2 (22). Additionally, if their taxable income has been nil for the past three consecutive years, and there is no likelihood of taxable income in the future due to physical disability or any other reasonable cause, they may apply for cancellation. Similarly, if the taxpayer is no longer required to file a return under Section 166, this can also serve as grounds for cancellation. Furthermore, in the event of the taxpayer's death, the dissolution of their business or organisation, or any other event that causes the business or entity to cease to exist, an application for cancellation of registration can be made. If the taxpayer permanently leaves Bangladesh and is no longer engaged in any income-generating activities within the country, they may also apply for cancellation. Registration can also be cancelled if it was issued erroneously or due to a change in the taxpayer's legal status. The law further states that registration can be cancelled based on any other valid and reasonable grounds. If any of the above reasons apply, and the taxpayer wishes to cancel their income tax registration—basically cancelling their TIN—they must first apply to the income tax authority, mentioning the reason for cancellation. Once the income tax authority receives an application for cancellation of registration, it may cancel the registration after verifying and confirming the application. However, certain conditions must be met for this to happen. Firstly, the taxpayer must have no outstanding tax liabilities, i.e., all taxes owed must be paid. Secondly, there must be no pending tax assessment matters. Thirdly, no disputes related to income tax should be pending in any forum. Lastly, the reasons provided by the taxpayer for cancellation must be truthful and substantiated. Additionally, the Board of Revenue has been granted powers under the Income Tax Act to cancel a taxpayer’s registration voluntarily in certain circumstances. For instance, if there is sufficient reason to cancel the registration, or if the Board has evidence that the taxpayer does not have a legitimate source of income. The Board may also cancel registration if it is discovered that the taxpayer’s registration was obtained for fraudulent purposes, such as involvement in financial crimes or money laundering, or if the information provided during registration is found to be incorrect, misleading, or false. However, even if a taxpayer’s registration is cancelled, the Board is not required to destroy all the taxpayer’s information and records. According to the law, the Board may preserve the records of de-registered taxpayers for the prescribed period, depending on the need or circumstances. These records can be used for future verification, legal purposes, or other administrative tax matters. Finally, \"deregistration,\" in legal terms, refers to the deactivation or dormancy of a taxpayer’s TIN, making it unsuitable for general use. This does not imply that the taxpayer’s previously collected information or records will be deleted; rather, they will be stored in the prescribed manner. While this provision offers relief to taxpayers by allowing them to discontinue an inactive or unnecessary registration, it also safeguards the interests of the tax authority by ensuring that relevant records remain available for audit, verification, investigation, or legal enforcement whenever required. In this way, the provision maintains continuity in tax administration and prevents misuse of deregistration as a means to evade liability, thereby promoting an orderly, transparent, and accountable tax system.

The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) has launched its outward remittance repatriation approval service on the BIDA One Stop Service (OSS) online portal, enabling fully digital processing for approvals related to royalty, technical know-how, technical assistance, and franchise fees. Previously available only through offline channels due to technical limitations, the service now offers a streamlined and transparent digital experience, according to a press release. Investors can submit applications online, track their progress, pay fees digitally, and receive approvals within seven working days, in line with the service level agreement (SLA). “We’ve closed yet another gap,” said Ashik Chowdhury, executive chairman of BIDA. “Investors can now benefit from a fully electronic and environment-friendly workflow, which brings greater efficiency and accountability to a critical process for both local and foreign industries operating in Bangladesh.” He also highlighted the recent launch of BanglaBiz, a unified digital platform developed by BIDA in collaboration with JICA. The portal currently connects the OSS platforms of BIDA and other investment promotion agencies. Once more than 25 services are fully integrated into BanglaBiz by the end of this month, investment processes are expected to become even faster and more user-friendly. With the latest addition, BIDA’s OSS now offers 142 investor services in total. This development reflects the agency’s continued commitment to improving the ease of doing business and facilitating investment, in line with the BIDA Act (2016), the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1947, amended in 2015), and Bangladesh Bank’s 2018 Foreign Exchange Guidelines. The Research and Analytics Unit (RAU), under the UNDP’s Transformative Economic Policy Programme (TEPP-II)—funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office—provided technical assistance and supported coordination efforts to digitise the process.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Telenor said on Thursday it would sell its 30.3 percent stake in Thailand’s True Corporation for 39 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.92 billion), its second divestment from Asia in recent months, lifting the Norwegian group's shares 8 percent. Telenor said it had signed an agreement with Arise Digital Technology Company, owned by Khun Suphachai Chearavanont, to sell 24.95 percent in True and then its remaining 5.35 percent stake two years after the closing of the initial deal. Telenor has been a major investor in Asian telecoms since the 1990s, building operations in Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Pakistan, but has recently said it is open to deals as the industry matures. MAY ALSO DO DEALS IN MALAYSIA, BANGLADESH “With the completion of the sale of Telenor Pakistan in December, and the agreement to sell our shares in True we have taken big steps in delivering on that strategy,” Telenor CEO Benedicte Schilbred Fasmer said in a statement. Telenor’s other Asian companies, Malaysia’s CelcomDigi where it owns 33.1 percent and Grameenphone where it holds a 55.8 percent stake, could also become subject to deals, the group said. “It’s business as usual until such time that any opportunities present themselves,” Chief Financial Officer Torbjorn Wist told Reuters in a telephone interview. “We know we're going to be focusing on delivering value to our remaining assets in Malaysia and Bangladesh. And then over time, we'll see if we can find structural opportunities for those as well,” Wist said. True is one of Thailand's biggest telecom operators with around 60 million customers. Telenor will book an accounting gain of 14.7 billion Norwegian crowns at the current exchange rate at the closing of the initial stake sale and said it aimed to provide further information next month on the use of the proceeds. The divestment, which is expected to close within a few months, is projected to boost Telenor’s return on capital employed and underpins the company’s goal of focusing more of its business in the Nordic region, it said.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. PRAN-RFL Group has partnered with Denmark’s Assentoft Aqua to establish an indoor, fully controlled intensive fish farming facility in Bangladesh using recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) technology, marking a significant move into industrial-scale aquaculture. RAS technology treats and reuses water through filtration, enabling high-density fish production with minimal environmental impact. Habiganj Agro Limited, a sister concern of PRAN-RFL Group, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Assentoft Aqua today at the PRAN Centre in Dhaka, according to a press release. The proposed project involves an estimated investment of €30 million. According to the MoU, the facility will be developed in multiple phases, with the preferred location at the Mirsharai Economic Zone or another mutually agreed site. The investment is expected to be rolled out over the next two years in two to three phases. The project will primarily focus on farming Asian seabass, with scope to introduce other high-value species such as grouper and hilsa. The target harvest size is set at 1,200 to 1,500 grams per fish. Most of the output will be export-oriented, while a portion may be supplied to the domestic market. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to have an annual production capacity of around 2,000 tonnes. Eleash Mridha, managing director of PRAN Group, said the initiative would introduce RAS technology to Bangladesh’s aquaculture sector and enable seabass production at an industrial scale for the first time in the country. Olesen said Marisco ApS, an associate of Assentoft Aqua, has been engaged with Bangladeshi enterprises since 2016 and has secured Danish government-backed financing for RAS-based aquaculture projects, expressing confidence in the success of the new partnership. The agreement was signed by Naser Ahmed, executive director of Habiganj Agro Limited, and Jens Ole Olesen, business development director of Assentoft Aqua, on behalf of their respective organisations.

This new initiative will run in parallel with the ongoing general OMS programme, which remains unchanged nationwide. The additional OMS was introduced despite adequate food stocks, as market monitoring revealed an upward trend in fine rice prices in some isolated areas. The press release described such price movements as \"undesirable\". At present, the general OMS programme covers 12 city corporations, 52 district headquarters municipalities, 15 labour-intensive upazilas, and five labour-intensive municipalities. Through this channel, a combined 11,417.5 tonnes of flour are sold daily at subsidised rates, Tk 24 per kg for loose flour and Tk 55 for a two-kg packet, along with 1,175 tonnes of rice at Tk 30 per kg. The government has also issued instructions to intensify market monitoring in the affected areas and take legal action to curb irregularities.

Textile millers said they would shut down their spinning mills from February 1 if the government fails to implement the commerce ministry’s recommendation to withdraw the duty-free import facility for 10-30 count cotton yarn within this month. Showkat Aziz Russell, president of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA), made the announcement at a press conference in Dhaka today. Earlier, the commerce ministry recommended that the National Board of Revenue (NBR) suspend the bond facility on imports of 10-30 count yarn to protect local spinning mills. Under the NBR’s bond facility, export-oriented industries are allowed to import raw materials duty-free on the condition that the finished goods are exported. Russell said the withdrawal of the duty-free facility would not amount to imposing a new tariff. Importers would still be able to claim duty drawbacks from the government, he added. He also mentioned that the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission (BTTC) recently recommended the commerce ministry withdraw the bond facility on imports of 10-30 count yarn, following a proposal from the BTMA.

Japan's exports to the United States dropped 11.1 percent in December and slipped more than four percent last year, official figures showed Thursday, as tariffs bite. In 2025, Japan's exports to the United States fell 4.1 percent, contributing to a 12.6 percent decline in Tokyo's trade surplus with Washington to 7.5 trillion yen ($47 billion), finance ministry data showed. A drop in the number of cars and auto parts exported, as well as rise in imports of liquified petroleum gas, cereals and power-generating machines, were primary factors in Tokyo's shrinking trade surplus with Washington, according to the data. In December, Tokyo's exports to Washington fell 11.1 percent to 1.81 trillion yen ($11.4 billion), with the trade surplus shrinking 31.7 percent to 690.6 billion yen ($4.4 billion). In July, Tokyo and Washington announced a trade deal lowering tariffs to 15 percent from a feared 25 percent. Crucially, that reduction included the auto sector, an industry that accounted for 30 percent of Japanese exports to the United States in 2024. However, Tokyo officials and business leaders have said the 15 percent tariffs are still high compared with the period before the second Trump administration. Japan's overall trade account logged a deficit of 2.65 trillion yen in 2025, its fifth consecutive deficit.

New Zealand batter Kane Williamson remains unique in his attention to tradition in the modern era of T20 cricket. The legendary batter arrived to play for Rajshahi Warriors in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) ahead of their qualifier match on Wednesday and spoke about his experiences in the ICC Test Championship, his batting in the modern era, and the Black Caps’ chances in the upcoming T20 World Cup during a media interaction on Thursday. The excerpts of it are as follows: Q: A lot happened during the 2019 ODI World Cup final against England. How did you keep yourself calm in that situation? Kane Williamson (KW): The 2019 World Cup was an incredible event. After over two months of cricket, to end up in a final and for it to play out as it did was a remarkable match. It was probably one of the great matches in the history of our sport. As a team, we were very focused on the style of cricket that we had come to know was important in England over that two-month period. At the end of the day, the result was what it was, but internally, we were proud of our efforts and how we went about our cricket. We committed to that wholeheartedly, and regarding the things outside your control, like some of the rules, you need to try and let them go, and that’s what we tried to do. Q: How great was it to win the Test Championship after that heartbreak in 2019? KW: It was an amazing match to be a part of. At the time, it was emotional and difficult to make sense of because we had played thousands of games of cricket and never experienced a result decided in that fashion. To go into the Test Championship final just a few months later was quite special. It felt fitting to put together a strong performance against a world-class side like India and come away with the mace. Q: How does the BPL differ from other franchises you have played in? KW: It is difficult to say definitively as I've just played one game. No doubt, there is a huge passion for cricket in Bangladesh. It has huge support, which we saw with the crowd yesterday. It is a great occasion, and you see how the cricketers are treated. You see a really high standard as well, with subtle differences across franchises in different countries. It looks like a fantastic competition. Q: You are known for your technical and grammatical batting. In modern cricket, do you think maintaining classical skills is possible, or is the demand for high strike rates destroying them? KW: The game just keeps evolving. For any player, it is about trying to use what they have to find ways to play a valuable role in teams. You might get 150-run wickets that require a little more craftsmanship, and then you get on some that might be 230-run wickets where you have to adjust accordingly. I think it is a wonderful thing that you're always trying to evolve. There is always a lot of talk about strike rates, but I think it is more about the contribution to the team and trying to win games. A good example was the partnership with Jimmy Neesham last night; he played a really valuable innings for the team. Q: There is a situation involving the ICC and the World Cup regarding Bangladesh and political issues. Do you think politics should interfere with cricket? KW: I don't know the ins and outs of that situation, so it is very difficult to comment. Ideally, you want teams to be involved in these world events. All these situations are specific, whether it's relationship-based between teams and countries. You would like to think there would be ways to work through some of these things, but these issues are potentially bigger than you and I sitting here having a conversation about it. Hopefully, they are resolved in time. Q: What are your thoughts on the upcoming T20 World Cup and New Zealand's chances? KW: In T20 cricket, anything can happen. Every team has match winners. On any given day, we know that teams can beat other teams. Our team has match winners as well, though we have a few injuries. Hopefully, some of those players will be fit in time. It will be a brilliant competition with upsets and different games influencing who makes the final.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Former Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful said politics should never be mixed with cricket and expressed hope that cricketing ties between Bangladesh and India would improve following next month’s national elections. His comments came after Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said there was “no scope for the Bangladesh teamto travel there to compete in the ICC T20 World Cup as the security situation in India had not changed,” following a meeting with national team players and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam Bulbul on Thursday.  Asked for his reaction, Ashraful told The Daily Star: “What can the BCB do? This decision has come from the government. “A new government will come after 22 days and I think the concerned authorities from both countries (Bangladesh and India) will sort things out. If a solution comes after that, I think there won’t be a long-term impact. When the new government comes, it will not take responsibility for the decisions of this government. “Politics should not come into the game, we don’t want that. Not playing in the World Cup is upsetting. But I’m hopeful that the two countries will make things right through dialogue after the new government comes in Bangladesh.”  Meanwhile, BCB president Aminul, however, said the board “will keep on fighting” to ensure Bangladesh’s participation in the T20 World Cup, scheduled to begin on February 7 and co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. He reiterated that Bangladesh are ready to play if their matches are held in Sri Lanka.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board “will keep on fighting” to ensure Bangladesh’s participation in the upcoming T20 World Cup, scheduled to begin on February 7 and co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. He reiterated that Bangladesh are ready to take part in the tournament if their matches are held in Sri Lanka. Bulbul made the remarks following a meeting on Thursday between the Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul, the BCB president and national team players at a city hotel. The meeting was the first such interaction with the players regarding Bangladesh’s participation in the marquee event and was attended by captains Najmul Hossain Shanto, Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz. After Asif Nazrul said that “there is no scope for the Bangladesh team to travel there to compete in the ICC T20 World Cup as the security situation in India had not changed,” Aminul briefed the media. “We take great pride in Bangladesh cricket, but we are concerned about world cricket,” Bulbul said. “At a time when world cricket is losing popularity, if the ICC leaves out a cricket-loving country like Bangladesh, the ICC will miss out. A country of almost 200 million people…. we kept believing throughout these days that each and every one of our people would wake up in the morning and would receive the news that Bangladesh are playing in the World Cup and the ICC has accepted their request. “We will carry on trying. We have not given up yet. We will communicate with them again today so that our boys can play the World Cup. “We have one need. We want to play in the World Cup. At this point, we don’t want to go to India. We want to play in Sri Lanka. We are ready, our team is ready.” Earlier on Wednesday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected the BCB’s request to relocate Bangladesh’s matches from India and decided to keep the tournament schedule unchanged following a board meeting. The ICC also gave the BCB a one-day deadline to decide, after consulting with the government, whether the team would travel to India for the tournament. “A global organisation can’t set a 24-hour deadline like this. We will keep fighting,” Bulbul said. Referring to a previous ICC event, he added: “February last year, when a country refused to compete in the Champions Trophy owing to security concerns, and when they conveyed their government’s decision to the ICC, it provided a neutral venue for them. Their team stayed in the same hotel, played all of their matches at the same venue for the entire Champions Trophy. It was a privilege. “We all know about the hybrid model. All of us are calling Sri Lanka a co-host [for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup], but they are not the co-host, they are hosting matches as a part of that hybrid model. “We gave its reference, we said as the hybrid model was introduced due to security concerns and the government’s reluctance, we took that line of discussion and tried to convince the ICC. But they rejected our request. We will again try today to explore whatever options available to speak with the ICC. “You have heard that there was a vote yesterday. I don’t want to disclose the numbers because the ICC told us not to, but I can see a number in different places.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

With this win, Bangladesh advanced to the Super Six stage of the qualifiers and moved closer to securing a place in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in England in June. The Tigresses now need to finish in the top four of the Super Six to qualify. This was Bangladesh’s third consecutive win, following earlier victories over the United States by 21 runs and Papua New Guinea by 30 runs.

Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul today said as the security situation in India has not changed, there is no scope for the Bangladesh team to travel there to compete in the ICC T20 World Cup. “There is no scope to change our decision. I believe we did not get justice from ICC. We still hope that the ICC will deliver justice,\" Asif Nazrul said this after a meeting with Bangladesh team cricketers and BCB officials. \"There are many instances in the world that matches took place at a different venue owing to security risks. We have genuine security risks. We hope that the ICC will take our genuine security risk into consideration and allow us to play in Sri Lanka,”  “There has been no change in the security risk situation regarding playing in India at present. This concern is not based on any abstract or hypothetical idea; rather, it stems from a real incident in which the Indian cricket board failed to provide security to one of our top players [Mustafizur Rahman] under pressure from extremists, and he was asked to leave India. “The country that could not provide security for one of our players, where the Indian cricket board is effectively an extended part of the government, and were unable or reluctant to provide security for one of our players under the pressure from extremists, the matches are happening in that very place. Their police, their security agencies will be entrusted to provide security for our cricketers.  “ICC made no attempts to convince us about this. Rather than speaking about the real incident, ICC discussed its standard security procedures. ICC took no real stance about our specific grievance. Even from the Indian government’s end, there was no attempts to convince us that the Mustafizur incident was an isolated incident, or we are sorry for it, we are taking these steps for your spectators, journalists and fans. No such communications were made, there was no attempt to convince us.” The adviser did no disclose what the exact discussions with the players, \"privileged communication\", and made it clear that it was the government's decision to not send the team to India under security concerns. “I want to say one thing very clearly, it was the government’s decision not to send the team for the World Cup in India considering security risks. Only the government decides whether there is any security threat about its citizens traveling to another country, there is no scope for any other considerations.” Earlier on Wednesday, theICC rejectedBangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB’s) request to relocate Bangladesh’s matches from India and chose to keep the tournament’s schedule unchanged after a board meeting. It also the BCB a one-day deadline to decide after conferring with the government whether they would travel to India for the tournament or not.

When we get there, the mystery will be revealed.” Yesterday, Bangladesh’s request to relocate its World Cup matches outside India was formally rejected by the ICC.

But the decision belongs to the board, and the government also has a say in the matter. They are our guardians, and as players, I feel we should do what they say,” he concluded.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Australian Open king Novak Djokovic said Thursday that record-breaking crowds were \"a very good problem\" despite complaints from some spectators about overcrowding and long queues. The first Grand Slam of the year has seen bumper attendances, with more than 100,000 streaming through the gates on the first day on Sunday. Organisers have each day trumpeted the large number of people packing into Melbourne Park. But with big crowds have come long queues to get into the venue and painful waits in sometimes fierce heat to watch a match. The wait time to enter the grounds on the first day was about two hours at one entry point, the ABC said. Asked his opinion on the issue, the 10-time champion Djokovic said: \"Having too much crowd on this or any other tennis tournament is a very good problem to have. \"I mean, it's a good sign. Obviously we want more attention, more people coming and wanting to watch the tennis live, follow it, livestream, et cetera,\" said the 38-year-old Serb, who first came to the tournament as a junior in the early 2000s. Organisers Tennis Australia also faced flak for scheduling the immensely popular Alexandra Eala of the Philippines on the intimate court 6 on Monday. Hundreds of her supporters were left disappointed and had to watch instead on a nearby big screen. Responding to a fan complaint on X, the tournament said it would learn for next year. Djokovic said he was aware of the chaos surrounding the Eala match, which she lost. \"You could argue that it was maybe a poor schedule, maybe they could schedule on a bigger court, yes,\" said Djokovic. \"Again, it's a good problem to have, to be honest. \"Let's just imagine if there's a lack of people coming or that stands are empty.\" Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Bangladesh cricket, already unsettled by developments surrounding the World Cup, received another jolt on Wednesday night as Sylhet Titans adviser Fahim Al Chowdhury brought an explosive allegation of match-fixing during the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). Fahim made the allegation shortly after Sylhet were knocked out of the tournament, losing by 12 runs to Rajshahi Warriors in the second qualifier. Visibly emotional after the defeat, he announced his resignation before the media. Later, he went live on social media and claimed that an individual within the team had sold the match. Chasing 166, Sylhet were in a strong position at one stage, needing 40 runs from 21 balls, but lost momentum towards the end and eventually fell short. Following the match, Fahim appeared on a Facebook Live session late at night and made detailed claims, alleging betrayal from within the camp. “Dear Bangladesh, dear people of Sylhet, I want to share some important information with you,” Fahim said during the live session. “Today’s match was severely tainted. I have received reliable information that a person involved in the match sold himself. He lied to us, betrayed Sylhet, and cheated Sylhet Titans. Most importantly, he cruelly betrayed the emotions of the people of Sylhet.” Fahim said the incident had left him shattered and insisted that the matter would not be brushed aside. “There was no need for this. He could have told me how much money he needed, and it would have been arranged,” he said. “This truth has truly broken me. I will not let this end here. The issue will be investigated thoroughly, and appropriate action will be taken against those responsible.” Describing the defeat as compromised, Fahim reiterated his claim that the loss was not a sporting one. “Today’s loss was a loss driven by betrayal,” he said. “Those who watched the match will understand what I mean. I want to tell you once again, this was not our loss. This loss was completely compromised. It was fixing, and Sylhet was betrayed.” He further said that the individual had made a grave mistake by playing with the emotions of Sylhet’s people. “I knew beforehand that the BPL was riddled with betrayal and gambling. But today, our players are completely demoralised. The entire people of Sylhet have been brought to tears because of betrayal. I will not let him go so easily,” Fahim said. Match-fixing allegations have surfaced repeatedly in previous editions of the BPL, although none have been resolved conclusively. In a bid to address corruption and irregularities, the Bangladesh Cricket Board had appointed former ICC Anti-Corruption Unit chief Alex Marshall for the current edition. While no fixing allegations had emerged earlier this season, irregularities and concerns over the quality of cricket persisted. The late-stage emergence of such allegations from an individual associated with a franchise has once again pushed the BPL into controversy.

Tareq Refat Ullah Khan, managing director and chief executive officer of BRAC Bank PLC, inaugurated the cards as the chief guest at the bank’s head office in Dhaka recently, according to a press release. Speaking at the event, Khan said, “SMEs are at the heart of Bangladesh’s economic growth. With the launch of the Visa Multicurrency SME Business Debit and Credit Cards, we are addressing a real, practical need, empowering SMEs to transact globally with greater confidence, transparency and regulatory alignment.” “We are thankful to Bangladesh Bank for providing the framework that makes this possible,” he added. Sabbir Ahmed, country manager for Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan at Visa, said digital payment solutions play a critical role in enabling SMEs to connect with global markets. “Our partnership with BRAC Bank reflects a shared commitment to supporting SMEs through secure, reliable and globally accepted payment solutions that simplify cross-border transactions and open new opportunities for growth,” he added.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Gold and other precious metals fell on Thursday as geopolitical tensions and safe-haven demand eased after US President Donald Trump backed down from new tariff threats and proposals to annex Greenland by force, while a firmer dollar also pressured prices. Spot gold was down 0.8 percent to $4,796.75 per ounce, as of 0524 GMT, after scaling a record peak of $4,887.82 in the previous session. US gold futures for February delivery lost 0.8 percent to $4,799.90 per ounce. “Reversal of comments by the US President was one factor that eased geopolitical tensions, and so we see a retracement in prices,” said ANZ commodity strategist Soni Kumari. Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force and suggested a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory that risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in decades. The dollar firmed, while Wall Street indexes also jogged higher on news of Trump’s reversal on tariffs. A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced metals more expensive for overseas buyers. Meanwhile, US Supreme Court justices signalled scepticism toward Trump’s unprecedented bid to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in a case with the central bank’s independence at stake. Traders await November’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, and weekly jobless claims, due later in the day, for further cues on monetary policy trajectory. The US Fed is broadly expected to maintain interest rates steady at its January meeting despite Trump’s calls for cuts. Gold, which does not yield interest, typically performs well in a low-interest-rate environment. “We still prefer gold as it has central bank backing while it also remains on firmer ground as compared to other industrially-exposed precious metals as geopolitical tensions still persist,” Kumari added. Goldman Sachs on Thursday raised its gold price forecast for December 2026 to $5,400 from $4,900/oz previously.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The German economy ended last year with momentum building but first quarter growth is likely to be modest, with inflation stabilising at 2 percent, the Bundesbank said in a monthly economic report on Thursday. Germany’s economy, Europe’s biggest, became stuck in stagnation in recent years as industry suffered a big recession and US tariffs ate deep into exports, putting recovery bets squarely on the government’s spending spree. “The somewhat more pessimistic expectations of companies recently suggest that economic output is likely to grow only moderately in the first quarter of this year,” the central bank said. “However, the easing of fiscal policy should provide a stronger boost later in the year.” Exports are still weak but industry appears to have bottomed out, households are spending more given big wage gains, and domestic demand is up sharply, likely driven by the government’s efforts to beef up defence spending, the report said. While the outlook is far better than any time in recent years, the recovery could take longer and the government is expected to cut its own growth forecast for this year to 1.0 percent from 1.3 percent, a source familiar with the projections told Reuters earlier this week. On inflation, the Bundesbank maintained a sanguine outlook, predicting German price growth remaining close to the European Central Bank’s 2 percent target in the coming months. Overall euro zone inflation is seen dipping below 2 percent, mostly on lower energy costs, before recovering next year as domestic price pressures hold around target.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Oil prices edged up on Thursday, after US President Donald Trump ratcheted down tension with Europe over his demand for Greenland, while disruptions in supply from two large fields in Kazakhstan and a better demand outlook for 2026 lent support. Brent crude was up 9 cents, or 0.14 percent, at $65.33 a barrel by 0320 GMT. West Texas Intermediate for March rose 13 cents, or 0.21 percent, to $60.75 a barrel. The contracts climbed more than 0.4 percent on Wednesday, following the previous day’s rise of 1.5 percent, after Opec+ producer Kazakhstan halted output at its Tengiz and Korolev oilfields because of issues regarding power distribution. Also on Wednesday, Trump suggested a deal was in sight over the Danish territory, while ruling out use of force to end a dispute that had risked the worst rupture in transatlantic relations in decades. A pact on Greenland would reduce downside risks from a US–Europe trade war and is supportive of the global economy and demand for oil, said Mingyu Gao, chief researcher for energy and chemicals at China Futures Co Ltd. “At the same time, the United States has not ruled out possible military involvement in Iran, which is also supporting oil prices,” Gao said. Trump said on Wednesday he hoped there would be no further US military action in Iran, but added the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program. Against the backdrop of the Greenland framework and the receding prospect of action in Iran, oil prices should hold around the level of $60, said Tony Sycamore, an analyst with online broker IG. Also aiding the market was a revised higher growth forecast for global oil demand in 2026 in the International Energy Agency’s latest monthly oil market report, suggesting a slightly narrower market surplus this year. US crude and gasoline stocks rose while distillate inventories fell last week, market sources said on Wednesday, citing figures from the American Petroleum Institute. Crude stocks rose by 3.04 million barrels in the week ended on January 16, according to the API, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gasoline inventories rose by 6.21 million barrels, while distillate inventories fell by 33,000 barrels, the sources said. Eight analysts polled by Reuters forecast an average rise of about 1.1 million barrels in crude inventories for the week to January 16. “High crude inventories are limiting further gains in oil prices in an oversupplied market,” said Yang An, an analyst at Haitong Futures.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Japan’s exports to the United States dropped 11.1 percent in December and slipped more than four percent last year, official figures showed Thursday, as tariffs bite. In 2025, Japan’s exports to the United States fell 4.1 percent, contributing to a 12.6 percent decline in Tokyo’s trade surplus with Washington to 7.5 trillion yen ($47 billion), finance ministry data showed. A drop in the number of cars and auto parts exported, as well as rise in imports of liquified petroleum gas, cereals and power-generating machines, were primary factors in Tokyo’s shrinking trade surplus with Washington, according to the data. In December, Tokyo’s exports to Washington fell 11.1 percent to 1.81 trillion yen ($11.4 billion), with the trade surplus shrinking 31.7 percent to 690.6 billion yen ($4.4 billion). In July, Tokyo and Washington announced a trade deal lowering tariffs to 15 percent from a feared 25 percent. Crucially, that reduction included the auto sector, an industry that accounted for 30 percent of Japanese exports to the United States in 2024. However, Tokyo officials and business leaders have said the 15 percent tariffs are still high compared with the period before the second Trump administration. Japan’s overall trade account logged a deficit of 2.65 trillion yen in 2025, its fifth consecutive deficit.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur yesterday urged Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed to fast-track amendments to the Bangladesh Bank Order and the Bank Companies Act ahead of the national election. In response, the adviser expressed doubt, saying he was “unsure” whether the two laws could be revised before the polls scheduled for February 12 this year. The discussion took place at a roundtable on banking sector reforms, jointly organised by the English daily The Financial Express and Mutual Trust Bank at Six Seasons Hotel in Dhaka. Salehuddin Ahmed was the chief guest, while the governor attended as the special guest. The event was also attended by managing directors of private and state-owned banks, alongside business leaders. Bankers and entrepreneurs put forward various suggestions and demands, with bank MDs backing the governor’s proposed reforms. However, the finance adviser pointed to time constraints and his limitations. When the governor said that passing the laws after the election would be difficult, he replied, “We will try. However, the time is short, so we are not sure how much can be accomplished.” On the independence of the central bank governor, he said it is definitely necessary. “But there is a lot of discussion about the governor’s status, whether the person should enjoy the status of a minister or not.” Referring to the governor’s position, Ahmed said, “A governor is a governor. I do not understand why a governor should be a minister.” The central bank governor said that seven laws or ordinances have been submitted to the government, but only two have been approved so far. These include the Bank Resolution Ordinance and the Deposit Protection Act. He said amendments to the Money Loan Courts Act also needed urgent approval to support banking reforms, but the proposal has been returned for corrections. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, said the Bangladesh Bank Order and Bank Companies Act should be approved before the election, as it will be harder to pass them afterwards. Sarif Zahir, chairman of United Commercial Bank, criticised long-term policy support. He said some businesspeople have benefited for 12 years, which is illogical. “Finance companies provide loans for a maximum of six years, but under the policy support, borrowers are getting 12 years to repay loans,” he added. Taskeen Ahmed, president of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI), said banking reforms are currently affecting the economy. Syed Abu Naser Bukhtear Ahmed, chairman of Agrani Bank, said if the government plans to merge banks, it can do so. But it must be handled cautiously. “If it announces this publicly, there will be a bank run. We have seen how deposit withdrawals surged after the liquidation of some financial institutions was announced,” he added. Shah Md Ahsan Habib, a professor at the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM), presented the keynote at the event. It was presided over by The Financial Express Editor Shamsul Huq Zahid.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The interim government’s advisory council yesterday approved the signing of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Japan, paving the way for duty-free market access for Bangladeshi exports to the East Asian country after LDC graduation. Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from LDC (least developed country) status in November this year. Once the agreement comes into effect, Japan will allow duty-free access for 7,379 products, which are 97 percent of Bangladesh’s export basket, including the main garment items, according to a press release from the commerce ministry. In return, Bangladesh will provide duty-free access to 1,039 Japanese products, largely in phases over 18 years. With the advisory council’s approval, all procedural steps required for signing the agreement have been completed, Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman told The Daily Star over the phone. He said the Japanese government has also approved the final draft, and the EPA is scheduled to be signed in Tokyo on February 6. Senior officials from both countries will attend the signing ceremony. The deal will be Bangladesh’s first full-fledged trade agreement with a major partner. So far, the country has signed only one preferential trade agreement,also with Japan, in December 2020. Unlike a conventional tariff-focused trade deal, the EPA covers a broad range of areas, including investment, services, labour standards, regulatory cooperation and compliance issues. Earlier, at a press conference in December last year, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu endorsed the draft during a phone conversation with Commerce Adviser Sk Bashir Uddin. The EPA introduces single-stage transformation provisions for garments, easing rules-of-origin requirements. The agreement also includes a chapter on trade in services. Bangladesh has agreed to open 97 sub-sectors across 12 service sectors to Japan, while Japan will open 120 sub-sectors to Bangladesh. The move is expected to facilitate greater Japanese investment and technology transfer. Japanese investment in Bangladesh currently stands at about $500 million, a small fraction of Japan’s global outward investment. The East Asian country remains Bangladesh’s largest export destination in Asia, with shipments currently standing at nearly $2 billion, driven largely by demand for Bangladeshi garments under Japan’s duty-free access scheme for LDCs. Last month, Japan reaffirmed to the World Trade Organisation that it would continue duty-free market access for Bangladesh for three more years, up to 2029. “The EPA between Bangladesh and Japan is an extremely important milestone for Bangladesh,” said Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, chairman of Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID). “It sends a strong signal that Bangladesh can successfully negotiate comprehensive trade agreements with major global partners,” he added. Bangladesh has been pursuing trade agreements with major partners to secure preferential market access after LDC graduation. Studies suggest the country could lose up to $8 billion in annual exports once LDC-related benefits expire. At present, around 73 percent of Bangladesh’s exports depend on LDC-related trade facilities. Bangladesh is the largest beneficiary of such preferences, accounting for 67 percent of benefits extended to all 44 LDCs. Negotiations on the EPA began in May 2024 and concluded after eight rounds, with the final round held in Tokyo in September last year.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Local textile millers have threatened to shut spinning units from February 1 for an indefinite period if the government does not withdraw the duty-free import facility for yarn by the end of this month. While speaking at a press conference at the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) office in Dhaka yesterday, BTMA leaders said the government would bear responsibility for any labour unrest that might follow factory closures. Spinners also warned that shutting production units could make it impossible to repay bank loans and other financial obligations. They said domestic mills are sitting on unsold stock worth Tk 12,500 crore as cheap Indian yarn floods the local market. The statement came amid opposition from apparel manufacturers and exporters to the commerce ministry’s recommendation to end duty-free benefits under the bonded warehouse facility for certain yarn imports. BTMA leaders say that local mills are capable of producing sufficient yarn to meet domestic demand. But the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) say domestic yarn prices for 10 to 30 count cotton are higher than imports. At the press conference, BTMA President Showkat Aziz Russell described the situation as a “national crisis” and an “emergency” for the local spinning sector. He said that many mills are operating at just 60 percent capacity due to a gas shortage, yet the government continues to collect tax and value-added tax (VAT) without reducing gas prices. He also pointed to past disruptions, noting that when India halted cotton exports, local millers faced trouble. Over-reliance on a single source, he said, could pose a serious threat to Bangladesh in the future. The BTMA president said after the country graduates from the least developed club in November this year, a minimum of 40 percent local value addition will be required to enjoy trade benefits in foreign markets. But the government has made no preparations. Russell also complained that the government is not allowing discussions on the sector’s challenges. He also called around 16 percent interest on bank loans “misguided”. Former BTMA director Razeeb Haider said the sector’s problems are not the result of recent events but of long-term disadvantages created by the Indian government’s subsidies for its textile and garment industry. “Now Bangladesh risks losing its competitiveness against Indian yarn,” he said. He said that 35 crore kilogrammes of cotton yarn were imported in fiscal year 2022-23, rising to 69.81 crore kilogrammes in fiscal year 2024-25, at costs of Tk 14,400 crore and Tk 26,400 crore, respectively. Nearly 78 percent of these imports in 2024-25 came from India, showing heavy dependence on a single source. “Are we securing local competitiveness in the yarn business?” Haider asked. “The local spinning mills are capable of supplying all required cotton yarn.” According to the spinners, they are not calling for a blanket suspension of yarn imports but only for 10 to 30-count yarn. Other counts, from 1 to 9 and 31 to 100, remain open to import. Russell praised the government for stopping yarn imports through land ports in early 2025, saying imports via sea now show the true picture of the market. India’s dynamic textile policy, backed by heavy subsidies, threatens the local $23 billion primary textile sector. BTMA Director Badsha Mia said local mills face pressure from the cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn. “Because of lost competitiveness, 50 to 60 mills have already closed over recent years as they could not survive the unfair competition,” he said. “The local primary textile sector is under even greater pressure as international clothing brands increasingly select foreign fabrics,” Mia said. As a result, Bangladesh exports $42 billion in garments but imports $32 billion in raw materials, leaving a retention value of just $10 billion, excluding environmental and water costs, he added. “Initially, the bonded warehouse facility was necessary for the garment sector,” he said, “but the local backward linkage industry has now matured and can support domestic needs.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Telenor said on Thursday it would sell its 30.3 percent stake in Thailand’s True Corporation for 39 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.92 billion), its second divestment from Asia in recent months, lifting the Norwegian group’s shares 8 percent. Telenor said it had signed an agreement with Arise Digital Technology Company, owned by Khun Suphachai Chearavanont, to sell 24.95 percent in True and then its remaining 5.35 percent stake two years after the closing of the initial deal. Telenor has been a major investor in Asian telecoms since the 1990s, building operations in Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Pakistan, but has recently said it is open to deals as the industry matures. MAY ALSO DO DEALS IN MALAYSIA, BANGLADESH “With the completion of the sale of Telenor Pakistan in December, and the agreement to sell our shares in True we have taken big steps in delivering on that strategy,” Telenor CEO Benedicte Schilbred Fasmer said in a statement. Telenor’s other Asian companies, Malaysia’s CelcomDigi where it owns 33.1 percent and Grameenphone where it holds a 55.8 percent stake, could also become subject to deals, the group said. “It’s business as usual until such time that any opportunities present themselves,” Chief Financial Officer Torbjorn Wist told Reuters in a telephone interview. “We know we’re going to be focusing on delivering value to our remaining assets in Malaysia and Bangladesh. And then over time, we’ll see if we can find structural opportunities for those as well,” Wist said. True is one of Thailand’s biggest telecom operators with around 60 million customers. Telenor will book an accounting gain of 14.7 billion Norwegian crowns at the current exchange rate at the closing of the initial stake sale and said it aimed to provide further information next month on the use of the proceeds. The divestment, which is expected to close within a few months, is projected to boost Telenor’s return on capital employed and underpins the company’s goal of focusing more of its business in the Nordic region, it said.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. PRAN-RFL Group has partnered with Denmark’s Assentoft Aqua to establish an indoor, fully controlled intensive fish farming facility in Bangladesh using recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) technology, marking a significant move into industrial-scale aquaculture. RAS technology treats and reuses water through filtration, enabling high-density fish production with minimal environmental impact. Habiganj Agro Limited, a sister concern of PRAN-RFL Group, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Assentoft Aqua yesterday at the PRAN Centre in Dhaka, according to a press release. The proposed project involves an estimated investment of €30 million (Tk 429 crore). According to the MoU, the facility will be developed in multiple phases, with the preferred location at the Mirsharai Economic Zone or another mutually agreed site. The investment is expected to be rolled out over the next two years in two to three phases. The project will primarily focus on farming Asian seabass, with scope to introduce other high-value species such as grouper and hilsa. The target harvest size is set at 1,200 to 1,500 grammes per fish. Most of the output will be export-oriented, while a portion may be supplied to the domestic market. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to have an annual production capacity of around 2,000 tonnes. Eleash Mridha, managing director of PRAN Group, said the initiative would introduce RAS technology to Bangladesh’s aquaculture sector and enable seabass production at an industrial scale for the first time in the country. Olesen said Marisco ApS, an associate of Assentoft Aqua, has been engaged with Bangladeshi enterprises since 2016 and has secured Danish government-backed financing for RAS-based aquaculture projects, expressing confidence in the success of the new partnership. Naser Ahmed, executive director of Habiganj Agro Limited, and Jens Ole Olesen, business development director of Assentoft Aqua, signed the agreement. Other senior officials from both organisations were also present at the programme.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Amid widespread anger, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) has backtracked on its earlier decision to bar five merging Islamic banks from providing any profit to depositors for 2024 and 2025. Under the latest instructions, the banking regulator said the commercial lenders will provide a provisional profit at an annual rate of 4 percent on Mudaraba savings and term deposit accounts for the period from January 1, 2024, to December 28, 2025. The revised decision will apply only to individual depositors, according to letters sent separately to each of the five banks on Wednesday. This decision was taken to ensure uniformity and transparency in profit distribution, said the central bank. The development comes just a week after the BB informed these banks that no profit would be considered on deposits for 2024 and 2025. The initial decision sparked anger and protests among savers, disrupting normal operations at some branches. The five banks -- First Security Islami Bank, Social Islami Bank, Union Bank, Global Islami Bank, and EXIM Bank -- are in the process of merging into a new state-run financial institution, Sammilito Islami Bank PLC. Profits already distributed must be recalculated where necessary, and any excess or shortfall should be adjusted accordingly, the BB said. For monthly and daily profit-based Mudaraba deposits, banks must ensure that the final profit distribution for 2024 and 2025 does not exceed the approved annual rate of 4 percent. The central bank also directed the shariah-based lenders to recalculate and adjust profits on all eligible Mudaraba accounts and submit a reconciliation statement to its Banking Regulation and Policy Department within three working days of completing the adjustment.

A famous mango seller named Mintu sold the cheapest and juiciest mangoes. One night, the inspector discovered mangoes were being stolen from the government orchard. Everyone shouted, “Mintu is the mastermind!” When caught, Mintu said, “I planned it, but I didn’t work alone.” He pointed to the guard who opened the gate, the driver who carried the mangoes, the shopkeeper who sold them, and even the tea man who supported them. A boy asked, “If one steals and many help, why blame only one?” The inspector replied, “Crime is a group performance.” Every big crime has many small helpers; silence and support are also crimes. We love chasing headlines like kids chasing kites, especially when the kite is already flying out of the country. Every big financial scandal in Bangladesh comes with a superstar villain, a flashy tycoon, a visionary businessman, or a successful defaulter who is now conveniently beyond our reach. The government, media, and social media then hold a national seminar in anger. But behind every such genius crook, there were bankers who approved, regulators who slept, auditors who blinked, and agencies who saw everything except the crime. And the best part? Almost all these helpful accomplices are still here, drawing salaries, signing documents, and attending seminars on good governance. Have we fired any bankers for enabling scams? Have we publicly punished bureaucrats who looked away? Hardly. By keeping them in the system, we are basically issuing an unofficial certificate, “Corruption Friendly Professional, Renewable License.” So next time a new fraud appears with a new hero, do not be surprised. The cast will be the same, only the lead actor will change. The interim government had a rare chance to break the corrupt system by focusing on what it could actually control. Everyone knows big fish are hard to catch, but local accomplices are not. If action had been taken against bankers, officials, and facilitators from both public and private sectors, at least new money swindlers could have been stopped. Instead, the government chased unreachable giants and let local enablers roam free, even rewarding some of them. The message was clear: survive corruption once, and you can survive anything. To break the support system behind money flight and rising NPLs in Bangladesh, accountability must reach the enablers. Bankers and officials who approve risky loans should face real consequences, not just transfers. Boards and regulators must be free from political influence, with fit-and-proper tests and disclosures of conflicts. Real-time data sharing among the Bangladesh Bank, FIU, ACC, NBR, and intelligence units can quickly freeze suspicious transactions. Financial penalties, professional bans, and confiscation of unexplained wealth will deter accomplices more than speeches. We also need transparency and consequences for powerful figures. For example, an election candidate with over a thousand crore in default loan faced only a mild request to repay rather than legal action, sending the wrong message. Publish defaulter lists, protect whistleblowers, and punish enablers. Also, remove bureaucrats and professors from business entities and committees when they lack real business experience. Cut the helpers, and the big fish will struggle to swim. UNODC estimates 2-5 percent of world GDP is laundered yearly. Asset recovery is also “few and far”. Some countries reduce flights by targeting enablers. In the 1MDB case, US authorities recovered and returned about $1.4 billion to Malaysia. Nigeria’s Abacha funds were repatriated with World Bank monitoring. Our leaders refused to learn from them! We keep hunting lions with whistles while the monkeys who open the cages get promotions. Big thieves need small helpers, and helpers love quiet corners. Until we stop rewarding the gate-openers of corruption, new “masterminds” will keep graduating every year. Our problem is not a shortage of villains; it is also a surplus of protected accomplices.

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Global demand for smartphones, personal computers and gaming consoles is expected to shrink this year as companies from Britain’s Raspberry Pi to HP Inc raise sticker prices to offset surging memory chip costs. The rapid build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure by US tech firms such as OpenAI, Alphabet-owned Google and Microsoft has absorbed much of the world’s memory chip supply, pushing up prices as manufacturers prioritize components for higher-margin data centers over consumer devices. Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, the world’s three largest producers of memory chips, have said in recent months that they were struggling to keep up with demand as they reported rosy quarterly earnings on the back of surging prices for their semiconductors. But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets. Research firms IDC and Counterpoint both now expect global smartphone sales to shrink at least 2 percent this year, in a sharp reversal from their growth outlook a few months ago. That would mark the first annual decline in shipments since 2023. The PC market is expected to shrink at least 4.9 percent in 2026, IDC estimated, after an 8.1 percent growth last year. Meanwhile, console sales are expected to fall 4.4 percent in the current year after an estimated growth of 5.8 percent in 2025, according to TrendForce. While several firms have already raised prices, industry heavyweights Apple and Dell face a tough choice: take on the costs and sacrifice margins or pass them onto consumers at the risk of stifling demand. “Manufacturers might absorb some costs but given the scale of the shortage, it is certainly going to show up as higher prices for consumers,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said. “It is going to result in more tepid consumer device sales in 2026. It will be a challenge for these companies that are trying to sell products during a time of broader inflation.” Pressure is being compounded by expectations that the price increases will persist, possibly into next year. Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge. “Over the last two quarters, we’ve seen 1,000 percent price inflation in some products and pricing is continuing to rise,” said Tobey Gonnerman, president of semiconductor distributor Fusion Worldwide. “Consumers can expect to pay significantly higher prices for laptops, mobile phones, wearables and gaming devices very soon.” Analysts believe the impact is likely to be most pronounced for manufacturers of low- and mid-range devices, such as Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and TCL Technology and PC firm Lenovo. TrendForce said last year that Dell and Lenovo were planning price hikes of as much as 20 percent early in 2026. Shares of all Raspberry Pi, Xiaomi, Dell, HP Inc and Lenovo fell in the last three months of 2025, with Xiaomi posting the biggest drop with a 27.2 percent decline. HP CEO Enrique Lores said in November the company would raise PC prices due to “significant” memory chip costs, while Raspberry Pi CEO called the cost surge “painful” in a December blog post announcing price increases for its devices. The weaker demand outlook could also hamper sales at electronics-focused retailers such as Best Buy, which had already warned last year that tariff-driven price increases could dissuade potential buyers. Apple will report earnings on January 29, while Dell is slated to report on February 26. Xiaomi usually reports in late March. Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals. The company typically holds prices of its flagship iPhone lineup in the US steady between its September launch events. Last year, it absorbed the hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff-related costs, instead of passing them on to customers. “Apple is better-positioned, as it uses contract pricing (rather than more volatile spot pricing) for its purchases, securing better prices,” Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said. “But it isn’t immune, and may need to raise prices to pass on higher input costs.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.",

    "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposesis strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The price of mild steel (MS) rod has inched up in recent months, supported by seasonal construction demand and a rebound in international scrap steel prices since December. Data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) and industry sources show that the price of 60-grade MS rod has risen by roughly 2 percent, from around Tk 84,000 per tonne in October to Tk 85,500 by the second week of January. Despite the recovery, prices remain well below the mid-2024 peak of nearly Tk 1 lakh per tonne. Last year, per tonne 60-grade MS rod prices retailed at a maximum price of Tk 89,000 in early August, before falling to Tk 86,000 in September. Industry insiders attribute the recent increase partly to higher global scrap prices. Imported scrap rose by about $20-$30 per tonne from autumn lows, driven by renewed buying from major consuming markets, particularly Turkey, along with winter-related supply constraints in Western countries. According to market participants, international scrap prices fell to around $336 per tonne on a CFR (cost and freight) basis during September and October, with some transactions reported even below that level. By early December, prices had rebounded to the $360–$370 per tonne range. “The price increased due to a slight rise in seasonal demand during winter, which is the peak season for the construction sector, as well as a commercial adjustment following the global scrap price hike,” said Tapan Sengupta, deputy managing director of BSRM, a leading steel manufacturer. He said the sector has been facing weak demand for more than a year and a half following political changes, as many development projects were put on hold and local government bodies lacked elected representatives to approve construction plans. Still, he estimated that demand for rods has risen by up to 10 percent compared with the lean season. Bangladesh’s monthly MS rod demand has fluctuated significantly from mid-2024, falling from around 6.5 lakh tonnes to about 4 lakh tonnes during lean periods amid economic uncertainty and lower government spending, according to the Bangladesh Steel Manufacturers Association (BSMA). “This rise in demand is still not enough to reach the levels seen after the Covid-19 period or to help the industry grow at a healthy rate,” Sengupta said, adding that the current trend may nevertheless offer limited relief from the prolonged slowdown. Market participants noted that Turkey, the world’s largest seaborne scrap buyer, has been a key driver of the recent global price increase, amid tight supply and strong demand for January shipments. Against this backdrop, local rod prices have risen by about Tk 1,500 per tonne over the past three months, particularly at smaller mills, according to industry insiders. Rising replacement costs due to higher scrap prices, along with volatile freight rates and longer lead times, have added further pressure. Manwar Hossain, former president of the BSMA and chairman of Anwar Group, said the steel industry has been among the sectors hardest hit since the pandemic. “Negative returns have caused serious capital erosion and forced many factories to shut down,” he said, adding that a price correction was overdue after a prolonged period of selling below cost. He said millers are still selling rods at Tk 4,000 to Tk 6,000 per tonne below production cost to keep operations running. Sumon Chowdhury, secretary general of the BSMA, echoed the concern, warning that a prolonged slowdown in construction activity could weigh on the broader economy. “The government and the elected administration must urgently engage with the private sector to revive the construction industry,” he said, noting that thousands of businesses are linked to the sector. “If construction slows, the ripple effect spreads across many others.” Chowdhury said an extended period of unusually low prices had led some buyers to adopt a “wait-and-see” approach. However, with global scrap supply tightening and mills adjusting prices, stockists and project suppliers may begin securing materials earlier to avoid higher costs later in the season. A more realistic pricing environment, he added, would help stabilise demand, allow mills to operate more consistently, and reduce disruptions caused by cash-flow stress.

The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) has launched its outward remittance repatriation approval service on the Bida One Stop Service (OSS) online portal, enabling fully digital processing for approvals related to royalty, technical know-how, technical assistance, and franchise fees. Previously available only through offline channels due to technical limitations, the service now offers a streamlined and transparent digital experience, according to a press release. Investors can submit applications online, track their progress, pay fees digitally, and receive approvals within seven working days, in line with the service level agreement (SLA). “We’ve closed yet another gap,” said Ashik Chowdhury, executive chairman of Bida. “Investors can now benefit from a fully electronic and environment-friendly workflow, which brings greater efficiency and accountability to a critical process for both local and foreign industries operating in Bangladesh.” He also highlighted the recent launch of BanglaBiz, a unified digital platform developed by Bida in collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). The portal currently connects the OSS platforms of Bida and other investment promotion agencies. Once more than 25 services are fully integrated into BanglaBiz by the end of this month, investment processes are expected to become even faster and more user-friendly. With the latest addition, Bida’s OSS now offers 142 investor services in total. This development reflects the agency’s continued commitment to improving the ease of doing business and facilitating investment, in line with the Bida Act (2016), the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1947, amended in 2015), and Bangladesh Bank’s 2018 Foreign Exchange Guidelines. The Research and Analytics Unit (RAU), under the UNDP’s Transformative Economic Policy Programme (TEPP-II) -- funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office -- provided technical assistance and supported coordination efforts to digitise the process.
